In quite a magical way, once you are fluent in the target language your new self is able to interact with people, information and situations which you’d never been able to weren’t it for your newly developed abilities.\nHowever, I’ve seen students who have a hard time enjoying the in-between. Too many times to consider it ‘chance’. The feeling I get from seeing them is they are on a quest for mastership of the ins and outs of the language and they cannot appreciate their progress until they’ve got there. They are overwhelmed by how much they ignore and can’t savor the small steps they are taking towards fluency.\nMotivation is essential, we’ve heard it so many times it comes as a platitude, but what about patience? Do we understand that these big powers we are after take time before they flourish? There are hardly any shortcuts. There is no magic pill. I don’t know of any magic method to learn a language other than patient dedication.\nThat is to me, magic nowadays, in these times of immediate rewards: to be consistent enough for long enough.\nUncomfortable is good as long as you understand it’s only temporary.\nAre you thinking about studying or already studying Spanish? I can\njoin you on your journey\n!\nIn any case, happy Spanish learning and thanks for reading.\nLeave a Reply\nCancel reply\nComment\nEnter your name or username to comment\nEnter your email address to comment\nEnter your website URL (optional)\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment."}

This is a packed bullet list with the most relevant ideas of this approach.\nThe CA is a teaching methodology developed with a focus on COMMUNICATION: the practical use of the target language rather than on its pure formal aspects.\nThe CA is based on FUNCTIONS: the concrete use we give to language. For example, “greeting people”, “asking for repetition”, “reacting to good news”.\nCA highlights the importance of real communication for learning to take place: When learners are involved in real communication, their natural strategies for language acquisition will be used to learn to use the language.\nFormal aspects of the language tend to be the “boring” part of the adventure when considered by themselves – detached from all context.\nA CA to teaching favours lesson aims that will help students practice and develop their linguistic competence, rather than their grammatical competence.\nThis does not mean that grammar is not addressed. Within the CA the student learns the relevant functions (grammar+vocabulary) they need in order to communicate effectively in the target language in concrete situations. (e.g. introducing yourself, apologizing, describing people, etc.)\nThis means that the intention or needs of the speaker define the “ingredients” we will need to incorporate in order to communicate what they need to successfully.\nThe CA aims at guiding student learning and providing them with language exponents used in the “real world”. No student finds pleasure in discovering that what was learnt in class shows useless once they left the classroom.\nLike everything else in language learning, there is no fixed rule or orthodoxy, and each case is different. Want to see the communicative approach in action? Please, feel free to visit the\nlessons menu\n.\nHappy Spanish learning,\nLeave a Reply\nCancel reply\nComment\nEnter your name or username to comment\nEnter your email address to comment\nEnter your website URL (optional)\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment."}

Welcome! This is Venture Out Spanish, a website focused on the study of Argentinian Spanish.\nCambridge Dictionary definition is perfect:\nto leave a safe place and go somewhere that may involve risks\nAnd that’s exactly the concept I want to stress. When we make the decision of learning a language, there will certainly be risks involved. Perhaps not those of a real jungle, but others of a different and equally fascinating kind.\nSometimes my Spanish speaking friends ask me ‘So, Mati, what does Venture Out mean in Spanish?’ and I have a hard time trying to explain. Not because the definition is complex, but because conveying the same idea in Spanish is not as straightforward.\nIf you look up for the phrasal verb definition, you’ll find that they deal with the idea of Adventure [aventura]. Through the noun we arrive to the pronominal verb [aventurarse], which conjugated takes us to:\n“AVENTU\nRA\nTE EN EL ESPAÑOL”.\nNotice that the stress in the imperative forms in Argentinian Spanish falls in the last sylable before the pronoun.\nI’m happy to be a part of this ecosystem and hope to contribute to the spread of Spanish learning.\nHope to stay in touch with you, and thanks for reading and engaging from now on.\nLeave a Reply\nCancel reply\nComment\nEnter your name or username to comment\nEnter your email address to comment\nEnter your website URL (optional)\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment."}

Hizo un papelón terrible.\nHacerse la rata\n| to be absent for school without your parents knowing it\nRamiro se hizo la rata y se quedó boludeando en la plaza.\nHacer una vaquita\n| to collect money as a group to buy or pay for something\nChe, ¿hacemos una vaquita y le compramos algo a Lu para el cumpleaños?\nHacerse el copado\n| to play cool\nSe hacen los copados, pero son altos garcas.\nI’ll soon be posting more idiomatic expressions with other common verbs.

One way to do it is by using -ísimo. The suffix -ísimo is a particle that you can attach to adjectives (and to some adverbs, as we discussed here with RE). Probably, this is not something you’ll only hear from Argentinians, but it’s something you’ll certainly get a lot from us.\nBasically, what you are going to be doing is dropping the last vowel and attaching -ísimo at the end of the word.\nDon’t forget to place the tilde on the “i”.\nAdjectives\nBUENO/A | bue\nní\nsimo/a\nMALO/A | ma\nlí\nsimo/a\nGRANDE | gran\ndí\nsimo/a\nCARO/A | ca\nrí\nsimo/a\nTRISTE | tris\ntí\nsimo/a\nCONTENTO/A | conten\ntí\nsimo/a\nABURRIDO/A | aburri\ndí\nsimo/a\nLARGO/A | lar\nguí\nsimo/a\nAdverbs\nTARDE | tard\nís\nimo\nTEMPRANO | tempra\nní\nsimo\nLEJOS | lejísimo\nThere are many more options that you can explore with your imagination and become an expert user.

Hope they help you thrive in your Spanish learning.\nThink of Spanish as a wild animal\nLanguages have a life of their own, and we should learn to respect that. You want to tame it but not turn it into a Tamagotchi. It is indeed the beauty of ‘the wild’ what we are after. Don’t learn words out of their natural habitats, but rather concentrate on getting them in the environment where they thrive. Don’t go to the zoo (isolated words in a list), go on a safari.\nEndure\nBe patient. Patience, motivation and regularity are key factors in learning anything. Language is no exception!\nDon’t be afraid of making mistakes.\nThere are lots of opportunities to make mistakes. Mistakes are good, we love mistakes. But let’s not repeat them, shall we?\nAsk questions\nIf you have a doubt, please ask it at once. Don’t stop to think how silly your question might be.\nQuestions lead our way through the target language (and life itself!). I like getting questions asked and, when I’m not able to answer on the spot, I will try to provide an answer later.\nRemember it’s all about making sense of the things you learn in class\nTry spotting new words or structures outside the classroom once you’ve officially learnt them.\nDevote some time to practise on your own every day\nGo over your class notes or class vocabulary and dig deeper. As little as 15 minutes can make a huge difference in your progress.\nLook for topics you are interested to learn about.\nKeep it meaningful to you. Choose wisely. Let me know what they are in case you feel we can work on them together.\nRecord yourself and listen to your own recordings.\nThis is a great way of assessing how far your real words are from the immaculate, silent words you hear in your mind.\nSurround yourself with Spanish sounds so they become familiar to your ears\nAs a beginner, you could watch Netflix films and series in Spanish and with Spanish subtitles, even when you don’t understand most of it, or listen to music in Spanish following the lyrics. Ask me for advice. I can be your guru into the realm of Argentinian music! If your Spanish level is conversational, you could listen to podcasts. There are thousands out there. I have a few to recommend.\nValue every goal you achieve\nRegardless of what your ultimate goals are, recognize your achievements, however small.\nVisualize yourself speaking Spanish well\nAs humans, not only do we have verbal language skills, but we also have the enormous power of imagination readily available for us to resort to. Picture yourself speaking good Spanish before you are really able to. Anticipate how you’ll feel when it becomes your reality. It will magicallyfoster your progress.\nHappy Spanish learning!\nLeave a Reply\nCancel reply\nComment\nEnter your name or username to comment\nEnter your email address to comment\nEnter your website URL (optional)\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment."}

A new world starts to open up as soon as you take your first step. You can feel it immediately, can’t you? All the excitement that this new adventure brings bursts from within.\nHowever, as nice as it may seem, it can be daunting, too. There are so many things to take in and it’s not always easy to decide which path to take. It’s for this reason that understanding the importance of learning to learn is of the essence.\nExcuse me, Matías, have you said ‘\nlearn to learn\n’? Exactly! You have to test different ways and find the one that works best for you.\nThere is an Argentinian singer, Fito Páez, who has a song called “Es sólo una cuestión de actitud” (it’s only a matter of attitude) and that’s a very suitable summary of what it takes to make progress in language learning once you get started. Beyond that point, es pura actitud. Not giving up, weathering the storm.\nThere are two very important questions to answer:\nWith a clear reason to learn and a good idea of the time available, you should take responsibility for your language learning process straightaway.\nFirst of all, assign the time Spanish deserves in your schedule. If you use Google Calendar, assign a 30- minute slot to expose yourself to Spanish radiation during that time period, and try not to miss it.\nDuring your practice you can revise your class notes/material, make lists of words you already know, study grammar topics, do some online practice, get authentic input (be it an article, a video, etc.)\nI would like to stress the importance of input —it’s an essential part of the equation. Repeat, mimic, imitate what you hear.\nMake the most out of every word you learn. Language learning is a fertile soil for metaphors. Let’s go with a cooking metaphor, then. Potatoes. You can eat them in virtually any imaginable way (except raw, of course). The treat-new-vocabulary-as-a-potato principle should be applied to every new word. Think all the different ways and in all the different situations where you could be using new words or phrases you learn.\nI’m\nhere\nif you need help!\nHappy Spanish learning,\nLeave a Reply\nCancel reply\nComment\nEnter your name or username to comment\nEnter your email address to comment\nEnter your website URL (optional)\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment."}

You’ll see that understanding the different uses of this typically Argentinian word is not complex, but quite on the contrary, surprisingly straightforward\nJust keep in mind that, like in many other aspects of language learning, honing the details is what really matters.\nReady? Let’s go.\n#1 CHE as a vocative\nThe first thing you should know is that CHE is used as a vocative. Did that help? In plain English, a vocative is:\na word that is used to address someone.\nSo, what this means is that you’ll hear us using it to get the attention of someone, either someone we know or not. Something like “Hey, [name]”\nChe, flaco/loco, se te cayó la billetera.\nChe, Nico, te está sonando el teléfono.\nAs you can see, it’s the first word we use. Once we make sure we get the person’s attention, we proceed to deliver the message.\n2# CHE used for emphasis\nWhen we make declarative statements, CHE is very frequently found at the end.\n¡Qué caro está todo, che!\n¡Qué calor que hace, che!\n¡Qué buena noticia, che!\n¡Qué suerte, che! Me alegro.\nThis is one use I particularly like.\n3# CHE used before a question\nWe frequently use it as a pivoting word before we ask something.\nChe, ¿de dónde sos, Mark?\nChe, Sole, ¿estás ocupada?\nIn a way, it’s similar to 1#, but the difference is that we are already in a conversation, and we are just opening our question with CHE.\n4# CHE used because it’s embedded in our every day communication\nAnd last, what is probably the most native level use of CHE, you’ll hear it as a ‘meaningless’ filler in our sentences.\nPero che…\nSerá posible, che. Siempre lo mismo en este país.\nAlright, that’s it.

English is an official language in 67 countries, French is second with 29 countries and Arabic is third, with 23.\nSpanish is further classified as a Romance language, along with Catalan, Italian, French, Portuguese and… Romanian!\nThe Spanish language derives from a particular type of spoken Latin. This dialect developed in the central-northern region of the Iberian Peninsula following the 5th-century demise of the Western Roman Empire.\nThere are more than a few discrepancies between the Spanish of Spain and that of Latin America. There are also countless differences in the Spanish language within Latin America itself!\nSpanish is a phonetic language.\nApart from Latin, Arabic is the largest contributor to Spanish. Words like alfombra (carpet), aceituna (olive) and almohada (pillow) come from Arabic.\nSpanish is a gendered language: the gender of adjectives and articles must agree with their accompanying nouns.\nIt’s estimated that almost 400 million people worldwide speak Spanish.\nSpanish is the third most used language on the internet.\nSpanish from Argentina and Uruguay use the second person vos instead of tú.\nWe use inverted exclamation and question marks at the beggining: ¡! | ¿?\nYou can refer to Spanish as “español” or “castellano”.\nSpecially in Buenos Aires, Uruguay and some other provinces the sound of /y/ and /ll/ is different to that of other Hispanic countries.\nThere are 17 tenses in Spanish (don’t panic, you don’t really need all of them!)\nIt is the second most studied language in the world\nSouth America= Latin America? South America is a geographical entity: the subcontinent or continent south of Central America.

These are not as country-especific as the hellos, but there are a few peculiarities.\nFirst things first. There are two basic options: CHAU and ADIÓS. CHAU is much more widely used in Latin America than ADIÓS. Keep Adiós only for formal settings.\nEvery goodbye is the end of an especific interaction, so you’ll probably need something else. My suggestion is that you use one of the phrase below:\nChau, gracias. | Bye, thanks\nChau, nos vemos. | Bye, see you\nChau, buen día. | Bye, have a good day\nChau, buenas noches. | Bye, good evening\nChau, buen finde. | Bye, have a good weekend. Finde is the short form of fin de semana.\nNos vemos. | See you.\nNos vemos mañana | See you tomorrow\nNos vemos la semana que viene | See you next week\nNos vemos en un rato | See you in a while\nNos vemos a la noche | See you tonight.\nHasta luego. | See you later\nHasta mañana. | See you\nHasta la próxima. | Until next time\nHasta la semana que viene. | Until next week\nOne more thing: in these times of virtual communication (be it written or else), you would include SALUDOS, UN ABRAZO or UN BESO.\nSALUDOS is the same as saying ‘regards’.\nUN ABRAZO is a peculiar one, as it translates as ‘a hug’. We use it in informal contexts. I’d say it’s a more masculine (?) word, as women prefer to say UN BESO.\nVoila, you are ready to farewell your friends now!\nIn\nVenture Out’s Beginners’ course\nwe go through this and other essential skills.

Sure thing, my friend!\nA very common question language learners ask themselves is whether their choice within the dialects of a target language will have a negative effect on their communication with Spanish native speakers from other countries.\nShort answer – NO\nIn the case of such a diverse language as Spanish, it’s highly probable that you’ll find\nmore than one word for the same thing\nwhatever your choice is. However, this is far from preventing a successful communication. Instead, it simply highlights how much of our national identities our national/regional dialects carry.\nWhen you learn from a native teacher, by default you’ll be influenced by their accent and you’ll learn vocabulary items under the name which they are familiar with, but your teacher’s should not be all the input you rely on if you really want to become a fluent speaker. We are very lucky to have thousands of\nonline resources\nto complement our learning available to us for free.\nBut let’s unveil the mistery: Is Argentina Spanish different?\nYes, it is, and I’ll tell you how.\nArgentina Spanish is different because we use the 2° person pronoun VOS instead of TÚ. This pronoun changes the conjugation of verbs in the present and imperative affirmative forms. This change shifts the stress in the verbs to the last sylable.\nThis way, please:\nIn the\npresent\n,\n-AR verbs turn to -ÁS | HABLAR – VOS HA\nBLÁS\n-ER verbs turn to -ÉS | SABER- VOS SA\nBÉS\n-IR verbs turn to -ÍS | VIVIR – VOS VI\nVÍS\nThe only exception is the verb SER, which turns to SOS – ¿De dónde SOS?\nIn the\naffirmative imperative\n,\n-AR verbs turn to -Á | HABLAR – HA\nBLÁ\n-ER verbs turn to -É | COMER – CO\nMÉ\n-IR verbs turn to -Í | ESCRIBIR – ESCRI\nBÍ\nThe only exceptions are the verb IR, which turns to ANDÁ and IRSE, which turns to ANDATE\nArgentina Spanish is different because we pronounce /y/ and /ll/ very similarly to an\nsh\n.\nWhen I say “\nY\no me\nll\namo Matías”, you’d hear “\nSh\no me\nsh\namo Matías”.\nArgentina Spanish is different because we avoid the future tense at all costs. Instead, we use the periphrasis [ir] a + INF.\nWe don’t say “Mañana\nIRÉ\n.”, we say “Mañana\nVOY A IR\n.”\nArgentina Spanish is different because we avoid the use of pretérito perfecto compuesto. Instead, we tend to use pretérito indefinido almost everywhere.\nWe don’t say “Esta mañana\nHE ESTADO\ncon Hernán.”, we say “Esta mañana\nESTUVE\ncon Hernán.”\nArgentina Spanish is different because we adopted (and adapted) many words that immigrants (mainly of Italian origins) brought over with them when they arrived to the country. This is known as\nLUNFARDO\nand we’ve addressed some of its peculiarities.\nI hope this post has helped you to answer the question that brought you here. Make sure you\ncheck the rest of the blog articles\n.\nAnd, of course, feel welcome to\nschedule a lesson\nwith me!\nUntil next time.\nHappy Spanish learning,\nNext Post »\nChe, boludo\nPrevious Post »\nArgentinian Spanish expressions | HACER\nYou might also want to read these articles:\nThe Paradox of Choice\nToday, I want to introduce the concept of paradox of choice, and show you how it’s detrimental to your progress.\nArgentinian Spanish Input (part 1)\nIn this post, I included podcasts you can try to leverage your learning with natural input.\nEl que te jedi\nLearn a fun way of saying you-know-who in Rioplatense Spanish.\nInfumable\nHave you heard Argentinians using this word before?

And landscapes, of course, but that’s another chapter. If I were a vegetarian, I would have no interest in visiting Argentina, as football and tango are not my cup of tea. Nobody can deny that beef is a buzz word whenever Argentina sneaks in a conversation.\nIn the region, Uruguay is king of beef and veal, with an average of 45 kilograms per capita followed by Argentina, with 38 kilograms and Brazil with 24.

Incas had tamed lamas and Aztecs turkeys, but that was it.\nAccording to history records, it was Cristobal Colón himself [aka Christopher Columbus] who fostered the multiplication of livestock in the Caribbean Islands, starting on his second voyage. From there, it was later brought to Central America and Mexico and the South of the US. By the time of the conquest of the Inca empire, cattle started to be brought further South, until eventually settling in the Pampas (precious grasslands since then).\nIt is estimated that by the 18th century there were 40 million heads of cattle.\nCurious fact: The hunting of cattle or “vaquerías” began when in 1596 the authorities of Asunción, at that time the capital of the governorate, declared that the “wild” cattle around Buenos Aires were to be considered the property of the conquistadors who “caught” them, since they were the heirs of the expeditionaries who had introduced them at their own expense.\nThe ritual of asado\nBack to what I wanted to tell you, asado is truly a ritual in Argentina. It starts at least 2 hours before everyone is sitting at the table ready to eat.  In that moment, the grill master is probably alone and getting everything ready to start a fire. If there will be guests coming over, they haven’t arrived yet. Each asador has their own technique to start a fire, but traditionally it requires paper, wood and coal.\nAbout 45 minutes later, once the embers are ready, it’s time to place the offal and meat. Usually, this is the time when guests arrive. Then, the rest is basically a matter of time.\nThat time in between is when Argentinians engage in conversation, make scholarly comments about the quality of the meat or the fire and eat UNA PICADA to kill the time. At some point before sitting down, choripanes will be served and then, slowly, each person takes their seat at the table. It’s time to eat, but before doing so, the grillmaster will receive the applause from diners who shout ‘Un aplauso para el asador!’ in unison.\nAsado vocabulary\nNow, let’s take care of some basic words that will help you navigate your way.\nParrilla\n: Es el grill en sí sobre el que se coloca la carne, pero también es la construcción en sí, con una chimenea para conducir el humo hacia arriba. Los restaurantes que se especializan en ‘asado’ se llaman ‘parrillas’ también. Tres palabras en una.\nCarbón\n: Para hacer un asado se puede usar carbón o leña. Es cuestión de gustos.\nLeña\n: La otra alternativa al carbón. Un asado con leña le da un sabor diferente a lo que se cocina.\nAsado\n: El asado tiene dos significados que pueden resultar confusos. Es el ritual en sí, como además un corte específico de carne vacuna: el costillar.\nVacío\n: El vacío es un corte muy tierno, sin hueso. Para muchos argentinos, una discusión eterna es si es más rico el vacío o el asado.\nAchuras\n: Las achuras son acompañamientos de la carne que se cocinan a la parrilla y se sirven primero. Cuando hablamos de achuras nos referimos al chorizo, a la morcilla, las mollejas, la provoleta, los chinchulines y el riñón.\nChorizo\n: El chorizo es como una salchicha grande. Se hace de cerdo o mezcla (cerdo y carne)\nChoripán\n: Es un sandwich de chorizo (choripán= chorizo+pan)\nMorcilla\n: La morcilla es también una especie de salchicha, pero para muchos extranjeros saber que está hecha a partir de sangre de cerdo y harina es demasiado.\nChinchulines\n: Los chinchulines son los intestinos de la vaca. Se preparan con limón.\nMollejas\n: Las mollejas son tiernas y deliciosas, pero una de las cosas más caras para cocinar en la parrilla.\nRiñón\n: Igual que los chinchulines, se condimentan con sal y limón.\nProvoleta\n: Una rodaja de queso provolone que se cocina a la parrilla sobre un molde.\nChimichurri\n: Un condimento picante preparado a base de aceite, vinagre, perejil, ajo, orégano, cebolla y morrones. Se lo usa para condimentar el choripán. If you say chimichurri 3 times in a mirror, you are entitled an Argentinian ID.\nMatambre de cerdo\n: El matambre de cerdo es un corte de carne muy delgado que se cocina muy rápido.\nAsador\n: Persona a cargo de la parrilla. Cuando el asado está listo y llega a la mesa decimos “¡Un aplauso para el asador!”\nPollo\n: No muy misterioso. Como su nombre indica, es pollo a la parrilla.\nEntraña\n: Es un corte de carne de vaca sin hueso. Muy tierno y sabroso.\nMalbec\n: Vino tinto indispensable para un auténtico asado.\nEnsalada rusa\n: Típica ensalada de asado preparada con cubos de papas y zanahorias hervidas, con arvejas y condimentada con mayonesa.\nEnsalada mixta\n: Otra de las ensaladas típicas. Lechuga y tomate.\nEnsalada de papa y huevo\n: No necesita presentación. A veces se le agrega mayonesa.\nPicada\n: En la previa del asado, para paliar el hambre es habitual preparar una picada con queso, jamón y otros aperitivos.\nI hope I’ve helped you with this article and made you want to try asado soon!\nBy the way, you can’t miss\nTHIS FILM\n, a true masterpiece.\nAnd also, check out\nTHIS YT CHANNEL\n.\n¡Buen provecho!\nNext Post »\nLong story short | Para hacerla corta\nPrevious Post »\nTo beat around the bush | Irse por las ramas\nYou might also want to read these articles:\nThe Paradox of Choice\nToday, I want to introduce the concept of paradox of choice, and show you how it’s detrimental to your progress.\nArgentinian Spanish Input (part 1)\nIn this post, I included podcasts you can try to leverage your learning with natural input.\nEl que te jedi\nLearn a fun way of saying you-know-who in Rioplatense Spanish.\nInfumable\nHave you heard Argentinians using this word before?

Asking questions in Spanish can be intimidating, but it’s an essential part of any real conversation, don’t you think? Being passive and letting the other person do all the talking will not only make the conversation unbalanced, but it will also prevent you from getting the information you need!\nSimply training to respond to questions may leave you at a disadvantage when trying to hold a conversation or gather information. It’s essential to also learn how to construct questions using appropriate grammar and vocabulary, as well as understanding cultural norms and expectations surrounding communication. This will help you become a more effective communicator and improve your overall fluency in the language.\nTwo types of questions\nIn Spanish, as in any language, there are two main types of questions:\nYES/NO questions\nand INFORMATION QUESTIONS.\nYes/no questions\nare used to confirm or deny a statement or to ask for confirmation of information. They can be formed by using the word order of a statement and adding an intonation that goes up at the end of the sentence, or using the word “verdad” (truth) at the end of the sentence.\nOn the other hand,\nInformation questions\nare used to obtain specific information. They are formed by using a question word.\nBasics first\nThere are a few basic elements to keep in mind when asking questions in Spanish:\nWord order:\nIn Spanish, the subject of the sentence typically comes before the verb, unlike in English where the subject comes after the verb.\nQuestion words\n: Common question words in Spanish include:\nqué | what\ncuál | which\ndónde | where\ncómo | how\ncuándo | when\npor qué | why\nquién | who\nThese words are used to introduce a question and indicate the type of information you are looking for.\nIntonation\n: In Spanish, due to what we addressed in 1., a change in intonation can change a statement into a question. If you make the voice go up at the end of a sentence it will sound like a question.\nUse of prepositions\n: Some questions in Spanish require the use of prepositions, such as “de” and “a,” to indicate the relationship between the subject and the verb. We use these prepositions first in our answers?\nQuestions you can try answering\nLastly, I’ll leave you with a list of questions you can try answering and making sense of:\n¿Cómo te llamás? – What is your name?\nMe llamo…\n¿De dónde sos? – Where are you from?\nSoy de…\n¿Qué idiomas hablás? – What languages do you speak?\nHablo…\n¿Dónde vivís? – Where do you live?\nVivo en…\n¿Cuánto hace que vivís ahí? – How long have you been living there?\nHace… años/meses\n¿Tenés hijos? – Do you have children?\nSí/No\n¿Vivís solo/a? – Do you live alone?\nSí/No\n¿Con quién vivís? – With whom do you live?\nCon…\n¿Cuántos años tenés? – How old are you?\nTengo …\n¿Cuándo es tu cumpleaños? – When is your birthday?\nEl * [número] de * [mes]\n¿Cuál es tu dirección de correo electrónico? – What is your email address?\n….. @(arroba)gmail.(punto)com\n¿Cuál es tu número de teléfono? – What is your phone number?\nEs\n¿Cuál es tu comida favorita? – What is your favorite food?\nEl/La…\n¿Te gusta viajar? – Do you like traveling?\nSí/No\nHope you find this guide useful,\nI’d be happy to join you in your Spanish learning!

{"url": "https://ventureoutspanish.com/boludo-argentina/", "title": "BOLUDO in Argentine Spanish | Venture Out Spanish", "text": "BOLUDO in Argentine Spanish\nPost author:\nMatías\nPost published:\nDecember 4, 2022\nReading time:\n8 mins read\nThank you for sharing this post!\nShare this content\nOpens in a new window\nOpens in a new window\nOpens in a new window\nOpens in a new window\nOpens in a new window\nOpens in a new window\nOver the years, BOLUDO has become a prominent word among those linked to our rich and often confusing slang words in Argentina.\nWe’ve discussed the uses of the word\nCHE\nas well as that of the phrase\nCHE, BOLUDO\n, so now it’s time to focus on the BOLUDO part of the story.\nMakes sense? Let’s go.\nMeaning of BOLUDO\nFirst things first: what does BOLUDO mean? Well, it’s an adjective used in Argentina (in either its masculine, femenine or gender inclusive singular or plural forms) to refer to someone who is not exactly brilliant, as in:\nMirá qué boludo este tipo lo que está diciendo.\n¡Qué boluda Susana, por favor!\n¡Hay que ser boludo!\n¿Se piensan que somos todos boludos?\n¿Me estás tomando de boludo?\nLeo parece medio tololo, pero no es ningún boludo.\nIn all the examples above, entonation is of the utmost importance. The “lu” syllable receives all the stress. You know\nwe love shortening words of three or more syllables\n. That’s how we arrive to a shortened, softer version:\n¡Qué bolú!\nWe already learned that, strangely enough, it’s a word which dwells between a mild curse word and a word of affection according to the context where it’s used. Among friends it’s used almost like ‘dear friend’.\n¡Felíz cumple, boludo/a!\n¡Me alegro boludo/a, qué bueno!\nMaking sense of the word\nIf we take the word literally, we could make some assumptions. First, we should know that the word for ‘balls’ in Spanish is ‘bolas’. Next, we should note that the -udo prefix implies big size. Big-balled does not take us very far, but we have something.\nIf we follow this big-balled line of investigation, we could agree that big balls may prevent a man from moving easily or too fast.\nThat slow movement might have a correlation with the lack of  ‘mental agility’ of that person. It’s twisted, but we could close the case here if we manage to find more evidence.\nOrigins of  the word BOLUDO\nHowever, this is quite far from what actually happened, according to other sources. It’s said that during the early and mid 1800s, while gauchos were fighting on the frontiers with the indigenous peoples, the boludos were the division that would take the front line of the battle, and usually getting the worst part of it.\nThese Gauchos didn’t have a choice as they were forcibly conscripted to these weak armies, and their weapons were the “\nboleadoras\n“.\nSomewhere during the 1890s a member of the Congress said that we shouldn’t be boludos implying we shouldn’t take unnecessary risks.\nTypes of BOLUDOS\nThere is a wide range of words that can specify what type of boludo we are dealing with:\nBoludo importante\nBoludo profesional\nBoludo en serio\nBoludo peligroso\nTremendo boludo\nReverendo boludo\nFlor de boludo\nPedazo de boludo\nPELOTUDO\nDid you know that there is a similar word when we use BOLUDO as ‘stupid’? It’s PELOTUDO.\nQué pelotudo el gol que se comió el arquero.\nQué pelotudo el dueño de ese auto. Mirá donde estacionó.\nIt can be used interchangeably in these contexts, but it’s slightly more aggressive. A person would never call their friends like this unless there is something wrong between them.\nOther options\nIf you don’t want to say the b word, you can always say:\n¡Qué gil!\n¡Qué gilún!\n¡Qué salame!\n¡Qué zonzo!\n¡Qué pavo!\nBOLUDEAR\nWe can put the\nword multiplier\ninto action and stop at the verb form. It points in the direction of being distracted:\nMe hice una cuenta en tinder para boludear.\nDejen de boludear y terminen eso por favor.\nMe pasé todo el sábado boludeando con la computadora\nBOLUDEZ\nAnd finally, we can check out the noun form. Una boludez is something silly, very simple or of no importance.\nNo digas boludeces.\nEl exámen fue una boludez.\nCuando tengas un minuto avisame que te quiero preguntar una boludez.\nAs I’ve shown we have many opportunities in the day to use BOLUDO so much.\nBefore you leave, please don’t forget to check the\nlessons menu\nand hit me up if you feel we can take a little shine off your Spanish!\nThanks for reading, and happy learning.\nNext Post »\nHow to speak Argentinian Spanish\nPrevious Post »\nChe, boludo\nYou might also want to read these articles:\nThe Paradox of Choice\nToday, I want to introduce the concept of paradox of choice, and show you how it’s detrimental to your progress.\nArgentinian Spanish Input (part 1)\nIn this post, I included podcasts you can try to leverage your learning with natural input.\nEl que te jedi\nLearn a fun way of saying you-know-who in Rioplatense Spanish.\nInfumable\nHave you heard Argentinians using this word before?

Are you considering learning Spanish but unsure about how challenging it may be? Well, my friend, you’re in luck! Spanish is a widely spoken language and it’s considered to be\none of the easiest languages for English speakers to learn\n.\nFirst of all, Spanish and English have a lot in common. We share a lot of vocabulary and grammar rules, which makes it a lot easier for English speakers to understand and speak Spanish. Many words in Spanish are easy to recognize and understand for English speakers. Plus, Spanish pronunciation is relatively straightforward, with a consistent relationship between sounds and letters.\nAnother thing that makes Spanish easy to learn is its grammatical structure. Spanish follows the subject-verb-object (SVO) word order, which is the same as English. And unlike some other languages, Spanish doesn’t have too many verb conjugations to remember. That means less stress for you!\nThere are also tons of language learning apps, textbooks, and online courses out there to help you improve your skills. Plus, there are plenty of native Spanish speakers who are more than happy to help you out.\nBut perhaps the best thing about learning Spanish is that Spanish is a phonetic language, meaning once you know the sound of each phoneme, it’ll remain consistent every time you come across that letter or pair of letters.\nNow, let’s not sugarcoat things. Learning any foreign language takes time and effort. But, if you’re determined to learn Spanish, you’ll find that it’s definitely doable. And remember, the ease of learning a language can vary from person to person. Some people might pick it up faster than others.\nBut no matter what, with so many resources and the support of the Spanish-speaking community, you’ll be speaking Spanish faster than you’d imagine.\nBelieve me, if you’re thinking about learning a new language, Spanish is a great choice. It will be easy for you as an English speaker to learn, it’s widely spoken, and there are plenty of resources available to help you along the way. So, what are you waiting for?

Have you any clue about its meaning? Kudos if you already know what they are! Anyway, whatever the case you are just a paragraph away from finding out or learning more about them.\nSo, a VESRE is a word spelled with its syllables reversed. It comes from the word ‘revés’, referring to the fact that the syllables are turned around. For some reason, they seem to inhabit Porteño Spanish comfortably. However, there is a pretty similar phenomenon in French, known as “verlan”.\nVESRES are one curious feature of Argentinian Lunfardo, but beware: for a language learner, particularly for one who lives in Buenos Aires or is planning to, I’d say it’s more important to be a passive user. Actively using them might be awkward.\nI get the impression that my parents’ generation was more keen on VESRES than mine. There are still a handful of them in every day casual conversation, but sometimes they just gush out of older people’s mouths.\nTwo syllable VESRES\nThe most common species are two syllable words. The list below is updated to 2022 standards.\nOFRI – frío | “Uy, ¡qué ofri hace!”\nLORCA – calor | “Qué lorca, por Dios!”\nFECA – café | “Hoy ya me tomé 3 fecas.”\nBEPI – pibe | “Con 24 ya tiene tres bepis.”\nDIOME – medio | “El aumento del alquiler me partió al diome.”\nSOPI – piso | “Se me cayó la porción de pizza al sopi.”\nZAPI – pizza | “¿Pedimos una zapi?”\nÑAPI – piña (golpe, puñetazo) | “No me jodas que te vas a comer una ñapi.”\nSOPRE – preso | “Leo está sopre desde 2020.”\nÑOBA – baño | “Tengo que ir al ñoba ya.”\nLLECA – calle | “Me encontré $100 en la lleca.”\nJOVIE – viejo | “Luis está un poco jovie para eso.”\nMIONCA – camión | “Estoy demorado porque hay un tremendo mionca estacionado en la puerta de mi casa y no puedo sacar el auto.”\nSOPE – peso | “No tengo un sope.”\nTOMUER – muerto | “Qué tomuer!”\nNote that:\nsome VESRES affect the original stress of the word (café | feca).\nwhen any of these words is used in the plural form, the “s” is attached to the last syllable.\nSpecial cases of VESREs\nThere are some interesting cases which are not exactly inversions. Let’s take a look.\nATRODEN – adentro\nARAFUE – afuera\nAnd lastly, there are some words which are formed by placing the last syllable at the front.\nDOBOLU – boludo\nDOLAPE – pelado\nCHOBORRA – borracho\nSOPERMI – permiso\nZOCHORI – chorizo\nThe list goes on, and it includes many terms of coarser language that I didn’t want to include here.\nAnyway, make sure you check the\nlessons section\nto practice or learn Argentinian Spanish with me.\nThanks for reading,\nand happy Spanish learning,\nNext Post »\nPatterns in languages\nPrevious Post »\nMaster the Argentinian accent\nYou might also want to read these articles:\nThe Paradox of Choice\nToday, I want to introduce the concept of paradox of choice, and show you how it’s detrimental to your progress.\nArgentinian Spanish Input (part 1)\nIn this post, I included podcasts you can try to leverage your learning with natural input.\nEl que te jedi\nLearn a fun way of saying you-know-who in Rioplatense Spanish.\nInfumable\nHave you heard Argentinians using this word before?

Raise your hand if you haven’t.\nLearning a language soon proves to be more challenging and demanding than we expected, especially if this is the first time we set out to learn a language. Usually our expectations differ quite shockingly from reality and this can make us overly critical about what we aimed at and where we are, perhaps even threatening the progress we’ve made so far. But fear not— we can turn this in our favor.\nIn order to get out of the quicksands of ‘the feeling of falling short’, we need to take action. As learners, it’s important that we take time to consider the approach we have to learning, and not just revolve around an X amount of time spent and/or facts collected along the way against the skills we’ve developed, as if there was only one way to proceed.\nIt’s very important that you understand that there are no beaten paths— you have to try and decide which learning strategies work and which don’t work for you. Besides, don’t worry too much about measuring progress— while it’s not necessarily impossible, it can trick us into believing that what we ‘know’ means something by itself.\nThe truth is that the real value of the knowledge of a language we possess is connected to what we are able to do with it. It won’t automatically credit us as successful users of our target language.\nMy idea today is to address three different aspects of the language learning process that I would like you to keep in mind.\nGRAMMAR\nOh, there is grammar. You are aware of it, right?\nBroadly speaking, students tend to fall into one of two groups when it comes to grammar: some see it as crucial to mastering their target language, while others fear or underestimate its importance and try to avoid it at all costs.\nAvoiding explicit grammar talk altogether can be just as challenging as obsessing over the hundreds of rules and exceptions. Grammar by itself is not going to save your soul, but not having a basic understanding of some underlying principles will definitely make your journey harder.\nDon’t fear grammar. Knowing what types of verbs there are out there, what a direct object or a noun phrase is or paying attention to syntax patterns (these are solely examples) can get you a long way, saving you time and frustrations.\nBesides, grammar gives learners a point of reference. It can help enhance your understanding and make explanations more digestible.\nMost of the time, you can tackle grammar topics on your own. Just remember that a spoken language is not a programming language. There is no perfect coding for a spoken language, so there’ll be more than one opportunity to find exceptions to the seemingly unchangeable rules you learn.\nLanguages can be unpredictable and don’t always behave as we expect. It’s worth noting that grammar rules were developed by linguists once languages came into existence, in an effort to prevent them from drifting too far. Romance languages (French, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish) evolved from Latin as the Roman Empire grew bigger and bigger.\nIt took some time before someone decided to try to make sense of it. In fact, the first grammar book ever written was published in 1492, shortly before Columbus set foot in America. In its prologue, its author good old Antonio de Nebrija wrote “Language was always the companion of empire, and followed it such that together they began, grew, and flourished—and, later, together they fell.”\nTo sum up, this is my take: embrace grammar, but don’t put all your hopes in it. Learning a language means more than learning its grammar.\nRECOMMENDED ARTICLE\n:\nAre you learning grammar in the most effective way?\nYOUR TUTOR\nYour tutor can play different roles according to their personality, teaching philosophy, age, experience and/or their own learning preferences.\nIt’s important that you consider if the tutor’s teaching style suits your learning style, and also that you understand what is their standpoint. We can adapt to your specific needs and learning style, but as I said above, we are not totally impartial.\nI like the jungle metaphor. I really see myself more like a safari guide, someone who can make it easier for you in unknown territory. We can do a lot together, but you’ll still need to work on your own because no one can learn the language for you.\nThat’s why I tend to prioritize a functional use of the language (i.e. how to do specific things with it), instead of focusing on pure grammar rules and exercises in class. I feel the masterclass format is great for YouTube, but not for meaningful human interaction. I believe students come to class to get involved and engaged in their learning and hopefully to enjoy their learning journey.\nI think the classroom, virtual as it is, is a space for developing your skills in a natural way. I don’t want to create an artificial bubble that bursts as soon as you step out into real-world conversations. What I like to do instead is to keep it real and  onversational.\nHowever, this does not leave grammar out of the conversation. Quite on the contrary, very frequently I clear doubts by referring to a specific grammar point. To clarify, what I mean with ‘functional use’ is that I don’t base my teaching on teaching grammar and I’m quite convinced that the ‘old way’ (I possess knowledge which I transfer to you in the form of concepts) is still around because that’s the way we were taught at school— which comes to show that the education system needs a refresh, too.\nMy point is that grammar rules are not the best a tutor can share with you. Books outperform us on this subject! What you get from a native tutor on a 1-to-1 setting is an intangible asset —the command that person has of their language at your disposal which, combined with the right tools and guidance, accounts for a more\neffective learning.\nIf you and your tutor are ‘tuned’ with each other, learning will take place incidentally. I’m not saying that improvisation is the key, I’m just saying that you have a voice in this matter. You are entitled to say what you’d like to learn (to do). Providing you are patient, you’ll get it right.\nThis is my take: everything you need to know to become a good user of Spanish is far more than what you can get from me, and I do my best to prove you that I’m just one piece of a bigger cake (your learning) and that at the end of the day, success is in your hands.\nINPUT\nInternet is changing the way we can learn a language. In the past, there were very limited options.\nNow, there are so many resources available that it can be difficult to decide how to best take advantage of them. We might feel intimidated, or go to the other extreme and bite off more than we can chew.\nTo me, input means that we have the opportunity to be exposed to real language models. We can listen to the sounds of our target language, learn vocabulary items in context, discover some cool expressions and incorporate patterns.\nI encourage you to look for YT channels, or podcasts, or a Netflix series, or websites, or even books to complement your learning. There’s a fuss about comprehensible input that makes it appear as the remedy to cure all ills. I’m quite convinced that by itself it’s not, but it can contribute to your overall progress.\nWe have to take it easy and accept that there are different levels of complexity and different ways to work with these numerous resources. The guidelines would be:\n1) limit the ‘size’ of your portion\n2) let go the desire to understand everything\n3) try to guide yourself by all contextual cues\n4) re iterate (watch/read/listen more than once) before you give up or pounce on a dictionary\n5) and know when you’ve had enough for the session\nI’m more than open to discussing these ideas with you.\nMay the force be with you!\nHappy Spanish learning,\nLeave a Reply\nCancel reply\nComment\nEnter your name or username to comment\nEnter your email address to comment\nEnter your website URL (optional)\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment."}

Spanish gives us lots of choice when it comes to greeting others, but what phrases do we use in greetings?\nTo kiss or not to kiss\nForeign visitors to Argentina are sometimes surprised to be greeted with a kiss. However, this only happens with people you are acquainted with and in informal settings. You are not going to be greeted with a kiss at your hotel or at a restaurant!\nIt was somewhat disorienting to avoid the kissing during the pandemic but gone are the times of covid and kisses are back. Women kiss women, women kiss men, men kiss men. One kiss on the cheek.\nAsking and answering to ‘How are you?’\nMoving on, Argentine Spanish greetings are not hard to master.\nBesides the ‘standard’ greetings which will work well, in friendly, informal contexts we like to say HOLA or BUENAS + one of the following ‘how are you’ phrases:\nEven when trying to translate these phrases might get you puzzled, think of all of them as equivalents of “how are you?” or “all well?”.\nHOW ARE YOU\n¿qué tal?\n¿cómo estás?\n¿cómo te va?\n¿cómo va?\n¿qué hacés?\n¿cómo va eso?\n¿cómo andamos?\n¿qué contás?\n¿qué onda?\nALL WELL?\n¿todo bien?\n¿todo tranqui?\n¿todo bien?\nHaving these two groups means you should only change your answer when you need to include “SÍ”.\n-¿Todo tranqui?\n-Sí, todo tranqui\n-¿Qué tal? ¿Todo bien?\n-Sí, todo bien.\nIn fact, I’d suggest you use “Hola, ¿qué tal? ¿todo bien?” as your go-to phrase. In Argentina, if someone walks into a shop or their place of work, they’ll most probably greet the shop attendant or their co-workers with “Hola, ¿qué tal? ¿todo bien?”.\nWhen you have to answer to “how are you?” questions, your go-to options are:\nBien, gracias, ¿y vos?\nTodo tranquilo, ¿y vos?\nTodo bien, por suerte.\nIf you want to master, Argentine Spanish greetings and much more, please head to the\nSpanish beginners’ course\nand take a look.\nHope to hear from you!\nNext Post »\nSpanish words that are different in Argentina | VERBS\nPrevious Post »\nThe word multiplier\nYou might also want to read these articles:\nThe Paradox of Choice\nToday, I want to introduce the concept of paradox of choice, and show you how it’s detrimental to your progress.\nArgentinian Spanish Input (part 1)\nIn this post, I included podcasts you can try to leverage your learning with natural input.\nEl que te jedi\nLearn a fun way of saying you-know-who in Rioplatense Spanish.\nInfumable\nHave you heard Argentinians using this word before?

Oh, boy! This is something! I like to think of it the way British and Australians use the word mate. It’s my loyal friend, my warm, silent companion.\nIf I only had to choose one thing to represent Argentina, it would definitely be mate. I’m crazy about it. I drink mate every single day of the week when I get up. The mate ritual makes my day. It’s honestly all I need to have a good (start of the) day.\nIf you visit Argentina, it won’t take long until you see a local drinking mate, and if you happen to make Argentinian friends, you’ll certainly share a mate round with them.\nHave you had the opportunity to try Argentinian mate yet? Do you even know what it is exactly?\nI’ll tell you.\nWhat is MATE?\nMate is an infusion made with yerba mate, a plant indigenous to the northeast area of present day Argentina, south of Brazil, as well as Uruguay and Paraguay. This species had long been popular among Guarani peoples, who inhabited this area.\nThe plant looks like this in case you are curious:\nIn the Guaraní language, yerba mate is called ‘caá yari’, but the word mate does come from the Guaraní word ‘mati,’ gourd. The gourd is dried and hollowed-out, and used as drinking vessel.\nThese gorgeous green leaves are harvested and dried and then grinded. Then they are packed in 500 grs or 1 kg packages, ready to use. By the time you sit to drink a mate they look like this:\nThat’s why when we list out the essentials to prepare mate we mention:\nyerba\nmate\nbombilla (metal straw)\nagua caliente\nHow does it taste like?\nAlthough the yerba mate leaves are dried, by default the infusion still tastes leafy and bitter.\nHowever, sometimes I want to drink it plain, and sometimes I prefer to drink it with a spoonful of honey. Some people use sugar, and others use sweetener.\nMateine\nJust like coffee has caffeine, mate comes with mateine. So, yes, mate may have similar effects to that of a cup of coffee and can be as addictive.\nDon’t forget that Mate is also an important part of the Uruguayan culture.\nLa leyenda de la yerba mate\nPaka Paka is a national TV channel which creates content for kids. In this episode they tell the story of yerba mate.\nI didn’t know about the existance of this great website called\nMATE EXPERIENCE\n. Make sure you check it out for more info.\nAnd if you have any other questions regarding the mate tradition, just\nhit me up\n.\nHappy mate drinking,\nUntil next time,\nNext Post »\nHow is VOS used in Argentina?\nPrevious Post »\nHow to speak Argentinian Spanish\nYou might also want to read these articles:\nThe Paradox of Choice\nToday, I want to introduce the concept of paradox of choice, and show you how it’s detrimental to your progress.\nArgentinian Spanish Input (part 1)\nIn this post, I included podcasts you can try to leverage your learning with natural input.\nEl que te jedi\nLearn a fun way of saying you-know-who in Rioplatense Spanish.\nInfumable\nHave you heard Argentinians using this word before?

One of the most common questions is about the difference between Spanish spoken in Spain and in other Latin American countries, like Argentina. I’ve decided to write this article to break down the differences and similarities between these two dialects of Spanish, and give you a better idea of which one is a better fit for you. So, sit back, relax, and let’s get into it.\nSpanish is one and is many\nSpanish, also known as Castilian, is spoken in many countries (\n21 to be precise\n), and it can vary depending on the region. Spanish spoken in Spain and Spanish spoken in Argentina are both considered standard forms of the language, but there are some differences in terms of vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation that we’ll address in this post:.\nPronunciation\nOne of the main differences between Spanish spoken in Spain and Spanish spoken in Argentina is pronunciation. Spanish spoken in Spain tends to have a more “lisped” sound, particularly when it comes to the letter “s,” while Spanish spoken in Argentina is characterized by a more “hard” or “aspirated” sound.\nThe sounds of the letters “y” and “ll” are also different between Spanish spoken in Spain and Spanish spoken in Argentina. In Spain the letters “y”  and “ll” are pronounced as a sound similar to the English “yes”, while in Argentina they are pronounced more like a /sh/. This is known as “yeísmo” and it is an important feature of\nRioplatense Spanish\n, which (in case you’ve just landed here) is spoken in Argentina, Uruguay and some areas of Paraguay.\nVocabulary\nAnother difference is in the vocabulary and expressions. Spanish spoken in Argentina has a lot of Italian influence, so you may find words and phrases that are not common in Spain. Additionally, Spanish spoken in Argentina tends to use more slang and colloquial language than Spanish spoken in Spain.\nIf you’re interested in learning more about the specifics, I’ve got you covered in these three articles. I’ve delved into the differences in vocabulary between Spanish spoken in Spain and Spanish spoken in Argentina, so you can have a better idea of what to expect:\nNOUNS\nVERBS\nADJECTIVES\nGrammar\nGrammatically, there are also some variations, such as the use of voseo, which is the use of the pronoun “VOS” and its corresponding verb conjugation, instead of “TÚ”.\nDespite these differences, the two varieties of Spanish are mutually intelligible and are considered standard forms of the language. It’s also worth noting that even though there may be some variations in pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar between different varieties of Spanish, these differences should not be a source of concern for you. Spanish is a widely spoken language and speakers of different varieties of Spanish can still communicate effectively with one another.\nKey takeaway\nDon’t worry if you’re not sure which variety of Spanish to focus on, as you will be able to communicate with Spanish speakers from different countries regardless.\nAnd if you’re leaning towards learning the Argentine Spanish, come join me and let’s dive into it together!

What is Argentinian Spanish? Is there even such thing?\nWherever you are from, can you say that your language is the same throughout your country? I can’t. Diversity is an undeniable feature of all languages, and the more you try to standardize it, the more diverse it becomes.\nArgentina is a pretty big country (over 3500 km from South to North), with as regional dialects as varied as the landscapes. To speak accurately, we should only call Argentinian Spanish ALL the Spanish spoken down here, throughout the country. However, what is commonly known as Argentinian Spanish is, strictly speaking Porteño Spanish.\nSo, if you want to understand Argentinian landscape in terms of accents, you’ll enjoy this post. Let’s try to break it down, shall we?\nSpanish variations\nJust like is the case with English, someone who has never studied English would assume that it is one and not many. Spanish takes this challenge to the next level, as there are\n21 countries where Spanish is the official language\n. Spaniards brought the language along with them when they conquered the American continent, but today, over 500 years later, the Spanish spoken in these lands is no longer that of Spain (if it ever was.)\nThe truth about Argentinian Spanish\nThis being said, in a country as big as Argentina it’s impossible to expect that all the regional identities can be reduced to a single one. At present, linguists have more or less set the dispute in these terms:\nSpanish Dialects in Argentina\nAs you see, Rioplatense Spansh takes over the central region of the country, where most of the urban centers are located, namely the Greater Buenos Aires area (15 million people), but also the whole of Buenos Aires and Santa Fé provinces along with most of Entre Ríos and La Pampa. This explains why it’s become so representative of the\nArgentinian accent\n.\nRioplatense Spanish\nI take no particular pride in the Spanish people speak in Buenos Aires. I just happen to be extremely acquainted with it as a result of my having been born here and my professional career as a Spanish tutor!\nOver time, as I’ve become more aware of the regional differences, I’ve also become more aware of how our Spanish dialect is perceived abroad. At the same time, I’ve grown increasingly interested in the\nfeatures of Porteño Spanish\n, i.e. the details that make the difference.\nI’ve covered this in further detail in the article linked in the previous paragraph, but if you want to stay in this article I’ll tell you what makes AR Spanish different:\nWe use VOS for the 2° person pronoun instead of TÚ. This impacts verb forms in the present tense and affirmative imperative. Read\nTHIS ARTICLE\nfor a deeper study of the topic.\nWe pronounce Ys and LLs like /sh/. This is known as YEHISMO [\nsheismo\n].\nOur dialect is flooded with words that only mean something to us. Read\nTHIS ARTICLE\nto know more!\nPorteño Spanish\nRioplatense Spanish is sometimes also referred to as ‘Porteño Spanish’, as\nporteños\nare the dwellers of Downtown Buenos Aires and it was there that the River Plate port -Argentina’s main foreign commercial route- was located.\nDue to the importance of the port in the early 20th Century, we could say Buenos Aires was like the epicenter and the Spanish spoken in this area has been a major reflection of Argentinian Spanish abroad.\nMy intent with this website is to contribute to the cause of understanding properly what Argentinian Spanish really means.\nAs always, feel welcome to visit the\nLESSONS MENU\n. Facts sometimes speak louder than words.\nHappy Spanish learning,\nFURTHER\nREADING\n:\n¡Che Boludo!

It’s true. We use ‘Che, boludo’ a lot.\nAll the time.\nWe’ve lost sight of how agressive it may sound to foreign ears to know that we call each other something like ‘asshole’ or ‘idiot’ to show affection.\nOnce I read someone who said something in the lines of “what can we expect other than to be ‘un país de boludos’ if we call each other like that?”\nThe\nuses of CHE\nhave already been covered in another post, but the combination of these two words is also really frequent and wasn’t included then.\nI explained that CHE can be used to grab the attention of another person, alright? Well, the addition of BOLUDO or its feminine counterpart BOLUDA after CHE is redundant, as it serves the same function.\nChe, boludo, ¿tenés idea cuánta gente vive en Argentina?\nChe, boluda, ¿vos sabés si el feriado del 17 se pasa al lunes?\nChe, boludo, mirá esto.\nChe, boluda, ¿viste las fotos de Clara en Bariloche?\nWe could use the name of the person instead, but using it when it’s clear who we are addressing would be too obviously redundant. At work and with acquaintances, however, boludo would be the placeholder for the person’s name.\nIn spite of its intrinsic meaning, when we say it it’s clear for us that we don’t mean to offend the other person and no Argentinian would feel aggrieved.\nThere is yet another use. If a friend overreacts we can extend the “e” in CHE and say:\nCheee, boludo/a, pará, ¿qué te pasa?\nLike I said other times for other cases, it’s better to play safe and understand the use of Che, boludo or Che, boluda passively rather than to force it into your conversations.\nHope this post gave you some insight.\nLet me know if you are up for\na lesson\n!\nHappy Spanish learning,\nNext Post »\nBOLUDO in Argentine Spanish\nPrevious Post »\nIs Argentina Spanish different?\nYou might also want to read these articles:\nThe Paradox of Choice\nToday, I want to introduce the concept of paradox of choice, and show you how it’s detrimental to your progress.\nArgentinian Spanish Input (part 1)\nIn this post, I included podcasts you can try to leverage your learning with natural input.\nEl que te jedi\nLearn a fun way of saying you-know-who in Rioplatense Spanish.\nInfumable\nHave you heard Argentinians using this word before?

I bring news from the future. In case you haven’t heard about OpenAI, you are missing something big.\nThis past week I spent some time chatting to my new friend\nCHAT GPT\n, and I strongly recommend that you follow my lead and take some time to play around with it. There are so many possibilities and opportunities in the AI game for language learners.\nWhat is Chat GPT?\nChat GPT is a new, different type of chatbot. One that you can have conversations with and unlike previous models, is trained to allow for real interactions. It’s not your average robot experience!\nOn the official website, they introduce it like this:\nWe’ve trained a model called ChatGPT which interacts in a conversational way. The dialogue format makes it possible for ChatGPT to answer followup questions, admit its mistakes, challenge incorrect premises, and reject inappropriate requests.\nChat GPT in action\nThis is just one demonstration for you. The possibilities are infinite.\nMatías\nHola, quiero aprender español!\nChat GPT\nHola! Estoy aquí para ayudarte a aprender español. ¿Hay algo en particular que te gustaría aprender sobre el idioma o tienes alguna pregunta en particular? Estoy dispuesto a ayudarte de cualquier manera que pueda.\nMatías\nConocés el español rioplatense?\nChat GPT\nSí, conozco el español rioplatense. El español rioplatense es un dialecto del español que se habla en la región del Río de la Plata, que incluye Argentina, Uruguay y algunas zonas de Brasil y Paraguay. El español rioplatense se caracteriza por tener un acento y una pronunciación muy distintivos, y también tiene algunas palabras y expresiones propias que no se utilizan en otros dialectos del español.\nAunque el español rioplatense es muy similar al español peninsular (el español hablado en España), hay algunas diferencias notables en la pronunciación y el vocabulario. Por ejemplo, en el español rioplatense, la “ll” se pronuncia como la “y” en “yate” y la “y” se pronuncia como la “sh” en “show”. También hay algunas palabras que son comunes en el español rioplatense y no se utilizan en otros dialectos del español, como “guevo” (testículo) o “pibe” (chico).\nMatías\nGracias. ¿Qué es lo primero que debería saber para hablar español?\nChat GPT\nLo primero que deberías saber es cómo pronunciar las letras y los sonidos del alfabeto español. A continuación, te voy a proporcionar una lista de las letras y sus correspondientes pronunciaciones en español:\nA – a (como en “casa”)\nB – be (como en “bebé”)\nC – ce (como en “cena”)\nD – de (como en “dedo”)\nE – e (como en “elefante”)\nF – efe (como en “foto”)\nG – ge (como en “gato”)\nH – hache (silenciosa)\nI – i (como en “igloo”)\nJ – jota (como en “jardín”)\nK – ka (silenciosa)\nL – ele (como en “leche”)\nM – eme (como en “mano”)\nN – ene (como en “noche”)\nÑ – eñe (como en “piña”)\nO – o (como en “opera”)\nP – pe (como en “perro”)\nQ – cu (como en “cuota”)\nR – erre (como en “perro”)\nS – ese (como en “sopa”)\nT – te (como en “tijera”)\nU – u (como en “universo”)\nV – uve (como en “vino”)\nW – doble ve (silenciosa)\nX – equis (como en “exacto”)\nY – i griega (como en “yeso”)\nZ – zeta (como en “zoo”)\n¡Espero que esto te ayude a empezar a aprender español! Si tienes alguna pregunta o si necesitas más información, no dudes en preguntar.\nMatías\nGenial, y cuáles son los usos del subjuntivo?\nChat GPT\nEl subjuntivo es un modo verbal que se utiliza para expresar acciones o estados que no son seguros o que no han ocurrido. En español, el subjuntivo se utiliza en las oraciones subordinadas, es decir, en aquellas que dependen de otra oración.\nAlgunos de los usos más comunes del subjuntivo son:\nExpresar deseos o esperanzas: Me gustaría que vinieras conmigo. (I would like you to come with me.)\nExpresar posibilidades o probabilidades: No sé si venga a la fiesta. (I don’t know if he will come to the party.)\nExpresar dudas o negaciones: No creo que llueva hoy. (I don’t think it will rain today.)\nExpresar ordenes o consejos: Sugiero que te vayas a casa. (I suggest you go home.)\nExpresar condiciones o supuestos: Si vinieras conmigo, podríamos ir al cine. (If you came with me, we could go to the movies.)\nEspero que esta información te sea útil. Si tienes más preguntas o necesitas más ayuda, no dudes en preguntar.\nMatías\nCómo puedo saber si un verbo es irregular?\nChat GPT\nExisten algunas reglas generales que pueden ayudarte a identificar si un verbo es irregular en español. Sin embargo, es importante tener en cuenta que hay muchos verbos irregulares en español y que no siempre es fácil predecir su conjugación. A continuación, te doy algunos consejos para identificar verbos irregulares:\nFíjate en el infinitivo del verbo: Muchos verbos irregulares tienen una forma de infinitivo única y fácilmente reconocible, como “ir” (to go) o “ser” (to be).\nObserva la terminación del verbo: Muchos verbos irregulares tienen una terminación única en el infinitivo, como “-ir”, “-er” o “-ar”. Sin embargo, hay muchos verbos irregulares que no siguen esta regla, por lo que debes tener cuidado al utilizarla.\nConsulta una lista de verbos irregulares: Hay muchas listas de verbos irregulares disponibles en línea o en libros de gramática que puedes consultar para ver si un verbo es irregular.\nEspero que estos consejos te ayuden a identificar verbos irregulares en español. Si tienes más preguntas o necesitas más ayuda, no dudes en preguntar.\nMatías\nConversemos sobre un tema que vos elijas.\nChat GPT\nClaro, estaría feliz de conversar sobre cualquier tema que elijas. ¿Hay algún tema en particular que te interese o prefieres que elija yo? Estoy dispuesto a hablar sobre cualquier cosa, desde la historia del idioma español hasta las últimas tendencias en tecnología. ¡Solo dime de qué te gustaría hablar y empezaremos!\nMatías\nElegí vos!\nChat GPT\nMuy bien, entonces elegiré hablar sobre el idioma español y su historia.\nEl español es un idioma romance que se desarrolló a partir del latín vulgar, el idioma que hablaban los romanos comunes. El español se habla en toda Hispanoamérica y en España, y también es hablado por un número significativo de personas en otros países de todo el mundo.\nEl español es un idioma muy rico y diversa, y ha influenciado a muchos otros idiomas a lo largo de la historia. Por ejemplo, muchas palabras en inglés tienen su origen en el español, como “taco”, “salsa”, y “gringo”.\nEl español también es un idioma muy musical, con una gran cantidad de palabras que riman y una sintaxis muy versátil. Esto lo hace ideal para la poesía y el canto, y ha dado lugar a algunas de las canciones más conocidas y queridas del mundo.\nEspero que hayas disfrutado esta pequeña charla sobre el idioma español. Si tienes más preguntas o te interesa el tema y quieres saber más, no dudes en preguntar. Estoy dispuesto a seguir hablando sobre el español y cualquier otro tema que te interese.\nMatías\nCuál es el aspecto más difícil del español?\nChat GPT\nEs difícil decir cuál es el aspecto más difícil del español, ya que depende mucho de la persona y de su conocimiento previo del idioma. Sin embargo, hay algunos aspectos del español que pueden ser más difíciles para los hablantes de otras lenguas:\nEl subjuntivo: El subjuntivo es un modo verbal que se utiliza para expresar acciones o estados que no son seguros o que no han ocurrido. Puede ser difícil para los hablantes de otras lenguas aprender a usar el subjuntivo correctamente, ya que muchas otras lenguas no tienen un modo verbal similar.\nLa conjugación verbal: El español tiene muchos verbos irregulares, y puede ser difícil para los hablantes de otras lenguas aprender a conjugarlos correctamente.\nEl acento y la pronunciación: El español tiene muchas reglas de pronunciación y acento que pueden ser difíciles de entender al principio. Por ejemplo, las palabras en español pueden tener acentos diacríticos, y las sílabas tónicas (o énfasis) en las palabras pueden variar según la región.\nEl género de las palabras: En español, todas las palabras tienen un género (masculino o femenino), y es importante usar el género correcto al hablar o escribir. Puede ser difícil para los hablantes de otras lenguas acostumbrarse a esta regla.\nEspero que esta información te ayude a entender algunos de los aspectos más difíciles del español. Si tienes más preguntas o necesitas más ayuda, no dudes en preguntar. Estoy dispuesto a ayudarte de cualquier manera que pueda.\nMatías\nMuchas gracias!\nChat GPT\nDe nada! Estoy feliz de poder ayudarte. Si tienes más preguntas o necesitas más ayuda con el español o cualquier otro tema, no dudes en preguntar. Estoy aquí para ayudarte de cualquier manera que pueda. ¡Buena suerte en tus estudios del español!\nHow can you use Chat GPT to learn Spanish?\nThis is my friend’s answer:\nAs a language model, I can provide a number of benefits to language learners who use me to learn and practice a language.

You’ve been taken by this peculiar\nmix of Spanish and Italian\n, and now you would like to understand exactly how to make your Spanish more Argentinian.\nIs that you?\nWell, my dear Watson, the answer is very simple: listen (and if possible speak) to natives as much as possible. Get obsessed, imitate and repeat, even when you are not totally sure what people are saying. Find pleasure in mirroring the intonation, stress and rhythm of natural speech.\nI’m sorry! Contrary to the expectations that might have brought you here, there is no recipe for authentically speaking Argentinian Spanish other than this.\nWell, hold on,\nas we’ve covered in other posts\n, there are a few things you can apply right now:\nThree quick tweaks can help you sound more Argentinian instantly:\nTurning all /y/ and /ll/ into sounds of ‘sh’.\nRead these words out loud and concentrate on getting an even /sh/ sound for all of them:\nya – allá – llamar – yang – callar – pantalla – playa – silla – cebolla – cosquillas\nyen – ayer – calle – Ayelén – llegar\nying\nyo – yoga – yogur – tuyo – uruguayo – coyote – amarillo – Nueva York – mayonesa\nlluvia – yuyo – Yucatán\nNonsensical poetry you can apply to your practice:\nEl yogur uruguayo me hace cosquillas.\nHay mucha mayonesa en las calles de Nueva York.\nAyelen, la uruguaya, hace clases de yoga con lluvia.\nAyer llegué a Yucatán y un coyoté huyó.\nEl amarillo es tuyo? Está en la silla\nYa no hay sillas.

The use of re in porteño spanish is an attempt to make up for that.\nAlthough not all adjectives will qualify as good matches for RE, you can rest assure it does in these examples. As a rule of thumb, if an adjective is compatible with RE, its opposite is also compatible.\nRE\nWITH ADJECTIVES\nChe, estás\nre flaco\n.\nLos pasajes de avión están\nre caros\na esta altura del año.\nConseguí este teléfono\nre barato\nen internet.\nCrearse una cuenta de mail es\nre fácil\n.\nMe imagino que el chino es un idioma\nre difícil\n.\nBariloche es un lugar\nre lindo\nde Argentina.\nEl helado de dulce de leche de Planeta Helado es\nre rico\n.\nMi vecino está\nre loco\n: se fue en bicicleta hasta Mendoza.\nRE\nWITH ADVERBS\n¿Y qué tal las vacas [vacaciones]?\nRe bien\n, un lugar hermoso.\nRe mal\n, un lugar horrible.\nPensaba que íbamos a tardar más, pero llegamos\nre rápido\n.\ntiempo pasa\nre lento\ncuando estás esperando algo.\nLa parada del bondi me queda\nre cerca\nde mi casa.\nNo veo mucho a mis primos porque viven en Tucumán y me queda\nre lejos\n.\nRE\nWITH GUSTAR\nOne last use of RE is with the verb GUSTAR.

For example:\n¿Disculpá? ¿Cómo dijiste que se llama el lugar?\n¿Disculpá? ¿Dijiste Loderman?\n¿Perdón?\nSimilarly, you could use ¿perdón? to signal you’re not following.

Such magical words, ain’t ’em? In this article I’ll share with you the story of how Argentina got its name.\nArgentina got its name from the Latin word “\nargentum\n“, which means silver. As it stands out today, silver was a hype at the time and has been ever since, as not only does our country allude to silver, but we also boast the Río de la Plata as well as the the cities of La Plata and Mar del Plata.\nThroughout the 16th century, the Spanish were primarily interested in exploiting the region’s natural resources, including silver and other precious metals. However, the Rio de la Plata area did not yield the large quantities of silver that the Spanish had hoped for, and it was not until the discovery of the rich silver mines in Potosi, Bolivia in 1545 that they were able to establish a major source of wealth and power in the region.\nThe 16th century was a time of significant change in the territories that now make up Argentina and neighboring countries. During this time, Spanish expeditions explored the area and established settlements in Paraguay, Uruguay, and present-day Argentina.\nOfficial records\nThe first recorded use of the name “Argentina” to refer to the region was in a poem written by the Spanish conquistador Martin del Barco Centenera (an avenue in present-day Buenos Aires). The poem, entitled “La Argentina,” was written in 1602 and is considered one of the earliest written works about the region. In the poem, del Barco Centenera praised the beauty and abundance of the land and its people, and he used the name “Argentina” to refer to the region.\nHowever, it wasn’t until 1860 that Argentina was officially named República Argentina.\nWhat happened in the meantime? Well… do you have a minute?\nNow that we are here…\nMaybe it’s a good time to tell you the story of the two foundations of Buenos Aires and some historical milestones.\nThe first attempt to establish a settlement in the Rio de la Plata region took place in 1536, when Spanish conquistador Pedro de Mendoza arrived with a small group of settlers. However, the settlement was abandoned just a few years later due to attacks by indigenous tribes and a lack of resources and Mendoza and his followers fled to the city of Asunción, in what is now Paraguay.\nIn 1580, another group of settlers was sent by the Spanish crown to establish a new settlement in the Rio de la Plata region. Juan de Garay led this group, and he established a settlement on the banks of the Rio de la Plata. This settlement proved to be more successful and eventually became the city of Buenos Aires. Garay, however, was killed in 1583.\nDuring the 17th century, Buenos Aires began to develop as a significant trading center, serving as a hub for the export of regional products like wheat, corn, wool and leather to Europe. By the end of the century, Buenos Aires had become one of the most important cities in the Rio de la Plata region and a key center for Spanish colonial trade in South America.\nWhile the export of wool and leather may not seem as lucrative as the export of precious metals, it was a significant source of wealth for the region at the time. Argentina had vast grasslands, the Pampas, which were ideal for raising cattle and sheep. The production of wool and leather from these animals was a major industry in the region and a significant source of revenue for the Spanish colonial government.\nIt’s important to note that as Buenos Aires was flourishing as a trading center, the indigenous population continued to be displaced and oppressed by the Spanish colonizers. Additionally, the development of the city was also fueled by the exploitation of enslaved African people, who were brought to the region by Spanish and British slave traders. The profits from the wool and leather exports were often used to fund the slave trade.\nThe Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata was established in 1776 by the Spanish crown and encompassed a large portion of South America, including present-day Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, and parts of Bolivia and Brazil. Buenos Aires became the capital of the new viceroyalty, solidifying its position as a key center of colonial power in the region.\nIt was not until 1816 that Argentina declared its independence from the Spanish crown, following a long period of struggle that began with the May Revolution in 1810 (The Buenos Aires Cabildo featuring at the start of the article was the epicenter of that event). The years that followed were marked by political turmoil and armed conflicts, including the civil war between the Unitarians, who favored a centralized government, and the Federals, who supported greater autonomy for the provinces.\nBetween 1853 and 1860, Argentina went through a period of political instability and violence known as the “Argentine Confederation”.\nEventually, the conflict was resolved in 1860 with the signing of the National Constitution, which established a federal government with a strong central authority.\nDespite the resolution of the conflict, tensions between the central government and the provinces have continued to be a recurring theme in Argentine politics to these days. Issues like the distribution of wealth and resources, taxation, federalism, and decentralization  being the main.\nHey, congratulations! Thanks for reading this far.

Let me help you with a visual cue: 🐄\nYes, the animal in the picture is a cow, but no, it’s definitely not asado, it’s dulce de leche!\nOne thing I love about writing these articles is that I get the chance to share with you some of the most representative things of my country. Today is the turn of DULCE DE LECHE. Along with\nMATE\nand\nASADO\n, it’s arguably what best typifies Argentine flavors.\nIn your stay in Argentina you’ll have many opportunities to discover this delicacy in different preparations: straight from the jar, in facturas, in ice-cream, on toasts, as the filling of alfajores, in cakes and pancakes, in sweets… you name it.\nI’d say at least 50% of our blood is dulce de leche.\nWhenever we travel abroad we crave for dulce de leche in all its forms. My weakness is one called Vauquita. I was lost for words to describe it and then I found this description:\nA Vauquita is a candy-like-bite that allows you to take with you Dulce de Leche in your pocket and to taste it anywhere\nwithout having to use a spoon. This magic happens because of the structure of a bite that Vauquita has. It is practically Dulce de Leche solidified!\nhttps://pampadirect.com/blog/vauquita-magical-dulce-de-leche/\nIf you want to challenge yourself and read a great article in Spanish that includes Borges, Bioy Casares and Vauquita,\nCLICK HERE\nAnd if you want a more visual approach to it, watch this video!\nOh, and please: treat yourself with a spoonful of dulce de leche as soon as you get the chance!\nSign up to the newsletter and download your FREE Argentinian Spanish Phrasebook!\nCLICK HERE\nUntil next time,\nNext Post »\nTo be in trouble | Estar en el horno\nPrevious Post »\nHow do you ask for repetition in Spanish?\nYou might also want to read these articles:\nThe Paradox of Choice\nToday, I want to introduce the concept of paradox of choice, and show you how it’s detrimental to your progress.\nArgentinian Spanish Input (part 1)\nIn this post, I included podcasts you can try to leverage your learning with natural input.\nEl que te jedi\nLearn a fun way of saying you-know-who in Rioplatense Spanish.\nInfumable\nHave you heard Argentinians using this word before?

Anything that is not purposefully said or written in a formal style will contain slang words to a greater or lesser extent. Words are pretty much like the clothes we wear. Just as clothes, for reasons which are not totally clear we tend to incorporate and use some of them more frequently (and proudly) than others.\nIn addition to this, Lunfardo is a peculiar mark of identity and differentiation between Argentine Spanish and other dialects of Spanish. What is crystal clear for an Argentinian might sound like a riddle for outsiders. Lunfardo is deeply rooted with a sense of belonging.\nI’ve always had an interest in Argentinian slang words, but ever since I’ve looked at them from the standpoint of a language learner, they’ve become all the more attractive.\nThis list is incomplete, but will surely give you some new words.\nNOUNS\nBirra | Beer\nBondi | Bus\nCana | Police\nFaso, Porro | Joint\nPucho | Cigarette\nGuita | Money\nMango | AR Pesos\nLaburo | Work\nQuilombo | A mess\nMacana | A complication.

Is Argentine Spanish a dialect of Spanish? And wait, what’s a dialect, anyway?\nLet’s get technical for a minute and include a definition of DIALECT. According to Oxford’s Dictionary definition, it is:\na particular form of a language which is peculiar to a specific region or social group.\nThis is a very good starting point and I’m ready to answer the opening question:\nYES\n. Argentine Spanish is a dialect. But one among many within the country. Its proper name is Rioplatense Spanish or Porteño Spanish. In fact,\nRioplatense Spanish\nhas come to be considered Argentine Spanish, when it’s only the dialect of the central region of Argentina.\nBut what exactly makes Argentina Spanish a dialect? The differences between Argentine Spanish and others involve grammatical, phonological and lexical aspects.\nFasten your seat belts! This is a packed list of the features of Rioplatense (or Porteño) Spanish. Follow the links for a more detailed post on the underlined topics.\nGRAMMAR\nVOSEO\n– the 2nd person singular from TÚ to VOS (affects the verb forms of the Present Indicative and the Imperative).\nWe do not use the Pretérito perfecto compuesto [he ido], but the Pretérito indefinido [fui].\nTo speak about the future, we use the periphrastic future: IR A + VERB (inf.) and not the simple Future.\nThe use of demonstratives “\nacá/ahí/allá\n” instead of “aquí/ahí/allí”.\nThe use of\n-ísimo | -ísima\nto intensify adjectives and adverbs.\nThe use of\nRE\nas an alternative way of intensifying adjectives.\nPHONOLOGICAL\n(sounds)\nYEISMO sound of /y/ and /ll/ as /sh/: lluvia, llaves, yeso, calle, llamada, ayuda, Yamila.\nThere is no differentiation between /s/, /c(+e/i)/, /z/ sounds: shoe, sausage, Cecilia.\nAspiration of the preconsonantal /s/ [c, g, d, l]: asco, frasco, desde, desdén, rasguñar, Alaska, escuela, marisco, Tesla, Isla, etc.\nCheck out\nthis extensive article on the Argentinian Accent\n.\nLEXICON\n(vocabulary)\nRioplatense Spanish was influenced by the speech of\nItalian immigrants\nwho arrived in the country between the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, which had a decisive influence on the vocabulary as well as the intonation of Argentine Spanish dialect.\nLUNFARDO\n(Argentinian slang) + ARGENTINISMOS\nUse of vocative “\nCHE\n“, and the polysemic “\nDALE\n“.\nDon’t leave empty handed!

{"url": "https://ventureoutspanish.com/the-water-metaphor/", "title": "The water metaphor | Venture Out Spanish", "text": "The water metaphor\nPost author:\nMatías\nPost published:\nMarch 22, 2023\nReading time:\n5 mins read\nThank you for sharing this post!\nShare this content\nOpens in a new window\nOpens in a new window\nOpens in a new window\nOpens in a new window\nOpens in a new window\nOpens in a new window\nLet’s do this together: Can you imagine how water would make for a good metaphor in language learning?\nYeah Mati, sure.\n‘A foreign language is like an angry sea of menacing beasts waiting to wreck your ship at the first opportunity.’\n‘A foreign language makes you feel that no matter what you do, you’ll sink.’\n‘A foreign language is like water because you can drown yourself in it.’\nNo no no. More bright than that!\nLet’s dive in! (pun intended)\nToday in class I was talking about our abilities in our native language and comparing them to what it feels when we are learning a foreign language.\nI said something like when we use our native language, it’s like having water running out of the tap. Words and phrases flow effortlessly, and we don’t have to think too much about grammar or vocabulary. Speaking, listening, reading, and writing in our native language feels natural and easy (most of the times, at least!).\nBut what happens when we try to use a foreign language? Suddenly, the water is not flowing so freely anymore. Just like people in places without easy access to it, we experience the frustrating and desperating feeling of scarcity.\nHow would you have to re-write your life if water was not a twist of your hand away but\n3, 4 or 5 miles away\n?\nSpeaking a foreign language can feel like carrying a heavy jug of water on our heads, and having it filled one drop at a time. We need to choose our words carefully, so we don’t spill anything.\nAnd to make things worse, not only is the source far but also there’s a limited amount we can carry each time.\nOne day, after an amount of time you can’t measure, you are not sure if the River of Meaning is closer than it was or you moved to live closer to it. The thing is, you just can’t understand how far you used to go to fetch your words. Ah, sweet mistery of life!\nOf course, the amount of water we have at our disposal depends on our level of language proficiency. Beginners might feel like they have only a trickle of water available to them, struggling to communicate even the simplest ideas. Intermediate learners might have a bit more water to work with, or maybe the place where they need to go and fetch it comes but still . Advanced learners might feel like they have a steady stream of water, but still need to be mindful of not wasting it or getting too comfortable.\nMoreover, the water metaphor can apply to different language skills, too. Listening might be like trying to catch drops of water in the air, where every word counts and we need to pay close attention to context and intonation. Speaking might be like using a straw to sip water from a narrow bottle, where we need to use the right muscles and tongue positions to produce sounds correctly. Reading might be like using a water filter, where we need to strain the text for meaning and make sure we understand the nuances. Writing might be like drawing water from a well, where we need to dig deep for ideas and structure them in a coherent way. (This paragraph, my friends, came from Chat GPT)\nSo, what can we learn from the water metaphor in language learning? Well, just like carrying water learning a foreign language can be tiring and challenging, but also life-sustaining and fulfilling.\nLet’s keep the water flowing, and keep learning and growing!\nLiked it?

If so, you might want to try mental imagery and visualization techniques\nin cold\nto improve your language learning process.\nStay tuned to learn exactly what this means.\nWhat is Mental Imagery and Visualization In Cold?\nMental imagery and visualization in cold refer to the practice of imagining and visualizing situations in your target language before actually being in them. This technique allows you to anticipate and prepare for possible scenarios and paths in a conversation, without relying on your inspiration in the spot.\nOne of its key benefits  is that it allows you to simulate real-life situations and practice your language skills in a safe, low-pressure environment.\nThe Importance of Mental Imagery and Visualization In Cold\nMany language learners underestimate the importance of mental imagery and visualization in cold in their learning process.\nPractice in cold can activate the same neural pathways as actual experiences, leading to a stronger memory and better recall. By imagining and visualizing situations in your target language, you are training your brain to anticipate and recognize patterns, which will help you better understand and process the language.\nAdditionally, mental imagery and visualization can boost your confidence and reduce anxiety when facing real-life situations. By preparing for possible scenarios and paths of conversation, you will feel more prepared and confident when the moment arrives.\nIt can potentially also help you identify areas where you may need more practice. For example, if you struggle with verb tenses or vocabulary related to a specific topic, you can focus your mental practice on those areas and develop a stronger grasp of them while you’re taking a walk or doing the dishes!\nAnticipating and Dealing with Possible Scenarios and Paths\nOne of the main benefits of mental imagery and visualization in cold is the ability to anticipate and prepare for possible scenarios and paths in a conversation. By asking yourself questions such as:\nWhere am I?\nWhat’s the context?\nAre other people around?\nWho am I talking to?\nDo I know the person?\nWhat am I talking about?\nWhat I might probably need to say?\nyou can create mental images of different situations and practice your responses accordingly.\nLet’s do this one time together, okay?\nLet me give you an example\nImagine that you’re a solo traveler, excitedly embarking on a journey to Argentina for the first time. As you make your plane lands in Ezeiza airport, you begin to mentally prepare yourself for the journey ahead.\nWhere am I?\nYou ask yourself. I’ve just arrived in Buenos Aires/I’m hailing a taxi/I’m checking in at the hotel/I’m buying something/ I’m choosing a beer at a local cervecería/I’m meeting someone for the first time.\nWhat I might probably need to say?\nAt customs:\nYou might need to answer questions about the purpose of your trip, the length of your stay, and where you’re staying.\nAt the airport:\nYou might need to ask for directions to your luggage, your next gate or the exit, or how to purchase a ticket for public transportation.\nWith fellow travelers:\nYou might need to introduce yourself, ask about their trip or offer to help or share a taxi.\nAt a cervecería:\nYou might need to ask for the recommended choice of lagers, or IPAs, or that kind of things\nAt a store:\nYou might need to ask for assistance finding a product or the price of an item. Paying, thanking.\nWith locals:\nYou might need to ask for directions or recommendations, start a conversation, or thank someone for their help or hospitality.\nYou also think about different cultural customs you might encounter, such as exchanging kisses on the cheek when greeting someone.\nMental imagery and visualization in cold is a powerful tool that can significantly enhance your language learning journey.\nSign up to the newsletter and download your FREE Argentinian Spanish Phrasebook!\nCLICK HERE\nTry it out for yourself!\nHappy Spanish learning,\nNext Post »\nDifferent uses of COPADO\nPrevious Post »\nVa como piña\nYou might also want to read these articles:\nThe Paradox of Choice\nToday, I want to introduce the concept of paradox of choice, and show you how it’s detrimental to your progress.\nArgentinian Spanish Input (part 1)\nIn this post, I included podcasts you can try to leverage your learning with natural input.\nEl que te jedi\nLearn a fun way of saying you-know-who in Rioplatense Spanish.\nInfumable\nHave you heard Argentinians using this word before?

But generally speaking, the best type of resource is an oral resource which can be followed with an accurate transcript. That’s why I always advice my students to use the CC filter in the YouTube video advanced search tab.\nOral resources can be a great way to practice your s\npeaking and listening skills\n. It can also help you to improve your pronunciation, fluency and comprehension. However, it can be intimidating or stressful for some learners.\nWritten resources can be a great way to practice your\nreading and writing skills\n.

Today I would like to go back to word stress and resume from there.\nAll words, even when they don’t take an accent mark, carry stress in one syllable. Take a look at this list of words. Notice the syllable in bold.\ncer\nte\nzas\nau\nsen\ncia\nrecono\nció\nfis\ncal\nan\nte\nresp\nues\nta\nperio\ndis\nta\npre\ngun\nta\n“\nAn\nte la pre\ngun\nta del perio\ndis\nta, el fis\ncal\nrecono\nció\nla au\nsen\ncia de cer\nte\nzas\n.”\nSo far so good? Great. Let’s go with another, a bit more twisted, example:\n“\nAnte la pregunta del periodista, el fiscal, claramente incómodado por la pregunta, reconoció la ausencia de certezas y manifestó que la investigación recién comienza\n.”\nThis sentence above supplies us with the following groups of meaning:\nUnder what circumstance – ante la pregunta del periodista\nWho – el fiscal\nHow did he look – claramente incomodado\nWhy – por la pregunta\nWhat he did – reconoció la ausencia de certezas y manifestó\nWhat he stated – que la investigación recién comienza\nWe have 5 chunks now:\nAntelapreguntadelperiodista, elfiscal, claramenteincomodado, reconociólausenciadecertezasymanifestó quelainvestigaciónreciéncomienza.\nToo much too soon? Try and read the resulting sentence observing the stressed syllable and with a falling intonation after each chunk:\nAntelapre\ngun\ntadelperiodista ↓, elfis\ncal\n↓, claramenteincomo\nda\ndo↓, recono\nció\nlausenciadecer\nte\nzas↓ ymanifes\ntó\n↓ quelainvestigaci\nón\n↓re\ncién\ncomienza↓.\nIt’s very important to keep this concept in mind and exercise in this way every time you read something.\nAnyway, let me know if I can be of help in any way.

In my view, the only thing you should not do is learn isolated lists of words detached from all context. If you do that, you’ll trick yourself to think you know lots of words, but they will never come out in conversation and will have no impact in your command of Spanish.\nIn one word, it’s not an effective strategy.\nThe word multiplier will train you in the magical wordbuilding process.\nThis tool is a useful and reliable way of making many words out of one. It works with adjectives, nouns, verbs and adverbs and after you get used to using it, it’ll help you master suffixes and prefixes and navigate your way through new words by recognizing what type of word you are dealing with.\nThe idea is really simple. You only need a print out of this chart or draw one like the one below with as many rows as you wish.\nOk, let’s say you’ve just learned the verb ESTUDIAR. The question you should ask yourself is ‘Do I know any words related to this?’ If you do, include it/them. (Don’t skip this step, as it gives you the opportunity to scan through your memory.)\nBase\nword\nADJECTIVE\nNOUN\nVERB\nADVERB\nESTUD-\nestudi\noso/a\nestudi\no\nestudi\nante\nestudi\nar\nestudi\nosamente\nNote that there is a base word, from which all forms stem. Bear in mind that not all words transform into other word types.\nThe key to getting this right is to have an idea of what suffixes do to the base word.\nHere is a useful reference:\nADJECTIVES\n-able\n-ible\n-ado | -ido (consider if it can be a participle)\n-ador\n-al\n-ano\n-ante\n-ente\n-ar (check if it’s not an infinitive)\n-ento\n-dor\n-dizo\nNOUNS\n-ción / -sión\n-or\n-ista\n-ía\n-ura\n-dad\n-ismo\nVERBS\n-ar\n-er\n-ir\nPARTICIPLES\n-ado\n-ido\nor is it has an irregular partciple?\nGERUND\n-ando (for -AR verbs)\n-iendo (for -ER/-IR verbs)\nADVERBS\nADJECTIVE + mente\nAlso, don’t forget that for verbs, adjectives and adverbs you can create the opposite by adding a prefix:\na-\nanti-\ndes-\ni-\nim-\nin-\nHope you enjoy using this tool.

In this post I’m going to show you the different uses of these two verbs.\nSome time ago I introduced the\nWORD MULTIPLIER\n. It’s a tool that you can use to explore all the derivatives of one new word. So, let’s put it to use!\nCagar as ‘to rip over’\nWhile in English we feel it’s about screwing, in Spanish is about shitting (pardon my French).\n“Compré un teléfono a muy buen precio online, pero me re cagaron. Nunca me lo mandaron.”\nFrom this meaning, we have the word\nGARCA\nto refer to the one who does the deed.\n“El dueño de ese taller es un garca. No le lleves el auto porque no te lo va a arreglar y te va a cobrar un montón de guita por nada.”\nCagar as ‘to cheat on someone’\nWhen someone cheats on their partner we hear things like:\n“Agustina cagó a Martín con un compañero del laburo.”\nCagar a pedos\nThis expression, believe it or not, means to tell off someone.\n“Mi viejo me cagó a pedos porque usé el auto sin pedirle permiso.”\nCagarse as ‘to get scared’\nCagar has its pronominal form. If something makes you feel scared, you say:\n“Cuando vi que sacaban un arma me cagué en las patas”\nCagón as ‘fearful’\nThat’s how we arrive to the adjective.\n“No me gusta andar en moto, soy muy cagón. Flasheo que me voy a caer”\nCagarse a trompadas / a piñas as ‘to have a fist fight’\n“Al final del partido los jugadores se cagaron a trompadas”\n(pronominal, reciprocal)\nCagar a trompadas as ‘beat the shit out of someone’\n“Al final del partido los jugadores cagaron a trompadas al árbitro”\nCagarse de (la) risa as ‘laugh one’s ass off’\nAnother use of the pronominal verb is this one.\n“Nos cagamos de (la) risa con los pibes.”\nCagarse de embole as ‘to get really bored’\n“Se me cortó la luz y me cagué de embole todo el día.”\nCagarse de hambre as ‘to be starving’\nYes, hunger has been reported as having this strange effect.\n“Ya vuelvo, me estoy cagando de hambre, voy a comprar algo para comer.”\nCagarse en [algo] as ‘not keep your word’\nImagine your partner and you agreed on something after an argument. Then, the same thing happens. They go:\n“Te estás cagando en lo que hablamos el otro día.”\nCagarse en todo as ‘not give a shit about anything’\nWhen you don’t care about anything, people might just accuse you saying something like:\n“No te podés cagar en todo, che. Algo te tiene que importar.”\nCagada as ‘mistake’ or ‘bummer’\nThe noun has two possible meanings. One is\nmistake\nand the other as\nbummer\nWhen we use it as mistake we use\nmandarse una cagada\n“Me mandé una flor de cagada con los pedidos a los proveedores. Creo que me van a rajar.”\nThe other possibility is\n“Qué cagada, está lloviendo. No vamos a poder hacer el asado.”\nSign up to the newsletter and download your FREE Argentinian Spanish Phrasebook!\nCLICK HERE\nHope you learned one thing or two with this post,\nGracias por leer,\nHappy Spanish learning,\nNext Post »\nHow to learn Spanish with podcasts?\nPrevious Post »\nDifferent uses of COPADO\nYou might also want to read these articles:\nThe Paradox of Choice\nToday, I want to introduce the concept of paradox of choice, and show you how it’s detrimental to your progress.\nArgentinian Spanish Input (part 1)\nIn this post, I included podcasts you can try to leverage your learning with natural input.\nEl que te jedi\nLearn a fun way of saying you-know-who in Rioplatense Spanish.\nInfumable\nHave you heard Argentinians using this word before?

Many successful language learners make their way through their target language on their own.\nSome students, don’t start with a tutor until a later, more advanced stage in their studies. I, for example, am trying to teach myself German and take it as an opportunity to try learning strategies for myself, and to understand what basic things I need to grasp as a beginner student. Perhaps I’ll look for a tutor once I feel ready to engage in a different dynamic, but I’ve learnt (and enjoyed learning) English and Portuguese with tutors.\nBut there are some perks. Today I’m going to share with you some arguments for working with a tutor to learn Spanish:\nPersonalized attention and support\n– A tutor provides individualized support and attention to help you reach your language learning goals.\nOpportunity to practice speaking\n– By working with a tutor, you have the chance to practice speaking the language and receive instant feedback on your pronunciation and speaking skills.\nTargeted focus on areas of difficulty\n– Tutors can help students overcome challenges by providing targeted instruction and practice in areas where you struggle.\nCustomized lesson plans\n– Tutors design lesson plans that are tailored to your learning style and specific language goals, maximizing your progress.\nAbility to ask questions\n– A tutor creates a safe space for you to ask questions and receive clarification on any topic.\nIncreased motivation and accountability\n– With the support of a tutor, you may feel more motivated and accountable, keeping you on track.\nExposure to native accent\n– Working with a tutor provides you with exposure to the pronunciation and speaking style of a native speaker, enhancing their overall language skills.\nInsights into the culture\n– Tutors can also provide you with insights into the culture and customs of the country where the language is spoken, helping them to better understand and connect with the people and the culture.\nHave I persuaded you?\nVisit the lessons menu\nand book your first lesson, then!\nSee you on the other side,\nNext Post »\nThat’s it | Corta la bocha\nPrevious Post »\nHow to learn Spanish with movies\nYou might also want to read these articles:\nThe Paradox of Choice\nToday, I want to introduce the concept of paradox of choice, and show you how it’s detrimental to your progress.\nArgentinian Spanish Input (part 1)\nIn this post, I included podcasts you can try to leverage your learning with natural input.\nEl que te jedi\nLearn a fun way of saying you-know-who in Rioplatense Spanish.\nInfumable\nHave you heard Argentinians using this word before?

In Argentinian Spanish, it’s LA PUTA MADRE. I can’t be sure whether it would translate as ‘fucking shit’ in English, but I feel it’s a good fit.\nYou smash your finger with a hammer:\n¡La puta madre!\nAlternatively, if it really hurts, you can go:\n¡La puta madre que lo remilparió!\nYou drop your phone and the screen smashes:\n¡La puta madre!\nYou realize you left you phone and have to go back all the way:\n¡La puta madre!\nA close second is LA CONCHA DE LA LORA [the cunt of the parrot]. You can use it and will hear it in exactly the same way.\nWhat’s good about these phrases is that you’re not addressing anyone in particular, you’re just letting out frustration or pain with the right words. In a coming post, I’ll address LA PUTA QUE TE PARIÓ, which usually has a recipient.\nUntil next time,\nHappy Spanish learning!\nNext Post »\nHow learning a language is like building a burger\nPrevious Post »\n¡Dejate de joder!\nYou might also want to read these articles:\nThe Paradox of Choice\nToday, I want to introduce the concept of paradox of choice, and show you how it’s detrimental to your progress.\nArgentinian Spanish Input (part 1)\nIn this post, I included podcasts you can try to leverage your learning with natural input.\nEl que te jedi\nLearn a fun way of saying you-know-who in Rioplatense Spanish.\nInfumable\nHave you heard Argentinians using this word before?

Yes, you read that right – a burger. Allow me to explain.\nWhen you start learning a new language, your first attempts at constructing sentences might resemble a plain burger. It has a patty, a bun, and that’s about it. In language terms, this means you might be able to string together a subject and a verb, but your sentences lack depth and complexity.\nBut just like how you can customize your burger with toppings, sauces, and other extras, you can also enhance your language skills by adding more components to your sentences. This could mean incorporating objects, adjectives, adverbs, and more.\nFor example, let’s say you want to express your love for cooking. You could simply say “I love cooking,” but to make it more interesting, you could add some context and backstory. For instance, “I love cooking, but I didn’t use to like cooking until I moved to live with my partner, who got me started.” By adding this additional information, you give your sentence more depth and personality, making it more memorable and engaging.\nAs you continue to build your language skills, you can get even more creative with your sentence structures and vocabulary. It’s like adding gourmet ingredients to your burger. You might start using idioms, metaphors, and colloquialisms to add even more flavor and nuance to your language.\nIt’s like building a delicious burger – you carefully layer each element to create a mouth-watering experience. Similarly, in language learning, you can layer each word and phrase to construct sentences that are both satisfying and meaningful.\nSo just keep experimenting with new vocabulary and expressions, and enjoy the fulfilling journey of mastering a new language!\nNext Post »\nThe Power of Retelling\nPrevious Post »\nGet angry with style: ¡LA PUTA MADRE!\nYou might also want to read these articles:\nThe Paradox of Choice\nToday, I want to introduce the concept of paradox of choice, and show you how it’s detrimental to your progress.\nArgentinian Spanish Input (part 1)\nIn this post, I included podcasts you can try to leverage your learning with natural input.\nEl que te jedi\nLearn a fun way of saying you-know-who in Rioplatense Spanish.\nInfumable\nHave you heard Argentinians using this word before?

Let’s move on\nCreate an immersion account!\nIt’s a good idea to feed the algorythm only Spanish related topics, and the best way to do this is by creating a separate profile for your Spanish learning. By doing this, you’ll have your personal account and your Spanish Input account on YouTube.\nDoing it is not difficult at all. Check this\nstep by step guide\n.\nFrom now on, make sure to subscribe channels relevant to your Spanish learning! You can find many in my resources section of this website.\nHow to search for YT videos with accurate transcripts?\nOK, now that you have a separate second channel we are ready to dig for gold.\nFirst, you need to search for a topic of your interest. It’s always best to run the search in your target language, so in case you don’t know some words, look them up on an online dictionary.\nWhen you run a search on YT, you’ll see the results for your query listed out.\nThis is what typically happens, but this time you’re not going to choose from those videos.\nInstead, you’ll click on\nFILTERS\nand the following dropdown menu will open:\nUnder\nFEATURES\n, you’re going to click over\nSubtitles/CC\nand YouTube will then automatically run the search again.\nNow you can pick from that new search.\nBy doing this, you avoid autogenerated subtitles —your worst enemy.\nHow to check if the transcript is OK?\nBe patient, though, as even videos with transcripts can be deceiving! Check the first minute following the transcript to see if a)punctuation, b) quotation marks and c) capitalization have been correctly used.\nIf not, go back and pick a different one.\nUse transcripts to visualize chunks\nYou can also use transcripts to visualize chunks.\nSome time ago I wrote a comprehensive article on the\nArgentinian Accent\nin which I broke down the elements of accent. What may look like a stand-alone word in writing is normally linked to the previous or following words when we speak. What better plan than tabulating through the transcript creating chunks?\nThis will allow you to see what you hear, like in a karaoke! Take a look at this example:\nLearning to do this might take some time, but it’s a very valuable skill.\nI expect that your YouTube experience will benefit from this guidance.\nStay well and happy Spanish learning,\nNext Post »\nBancame = Esperame\nPrevious Post »\nThe Power of Retelling\nYou might also want to read these articles:\nThe Paradox of Choice\nToday, I want to introduce the concept of paradox of choice, and show you how it’s detrimental to your progress.\nArgentinian Spanish Input (part 1)\nIn this post, I included podcasts you can try to leverage your learning with natural input.\nEl que te jedi\nLearn a fun way of saying you-know-who in Rioplatense Spanish.\nInfumable\nHave you heard Argentinians using this word before?

Humans have lived on this planet telling and retelling stories for at least the past 70.000 years, why not apply it to your language learning then?\nI emphasize the power of retelling in both my language learning lessons and in this post because I’ve personally tried it countless times with my students and saw it work time and time again. It helps a lot not only in making it more realistic, but also it provides you with so many opportunities to develop your speaking and writing skills..\nThe power of storytelling\nJust think about it.. When you retell a story or recount an experience in a new language, you are actively engaging with the language and using it in a way that is relevant to your own life.\nYou’re not making up imaginary stories, but rather recalling actual events that you have experienced or related to in some way and that are all wrapped up in actual emotions and feelings. This personal connection to the language can also help to increase your motivation and retention of new vocabulary.\nOpportunities for retelling\nYou can find inspiration everywhere:\nDaily life experiences\nLife experiences\nNews articles\nCurrent events\nMovies and TV shows\nBooks\nPodcasts\nTips for effective retelling\nIn order to succeed in your retelling, there are some things you should pay keep in mind:\nFocus on the main ideas and key points, don’t worry about details.\nTake notes.\nUse your own words, but try to incorporate new vocabulary you learned into your account of the events.\nRecord yourself and listen for feedback.\nChallenge yourself to retell longer or more complex stories over time.\nAnd last, the most important think to remember: Don’t be afraid to make mistakes! Retelling is all about practicing and improving, so embrace the process and keep pushing yourself to try new things.\nHappy Spanish learning,\nNext Post »\nHow to create a YouTube immersion account\nPrevious Post »\nHow learning a language is like building a burger\nYou might also want to read these articles:\nThe Paradox of Choice\nToday, I want to introduce the concept of paradox of choice, and show you how it’s detrimental to your progress.\nArgentinian Spanish Input (part 1)\nIn this post, I included podcasts you can try to leverage your learning with natural input.\nEl que te jedi\nLearn a fun way of saying you-know-who in Rioplatense Spanish.\nInfumable\nHave you heard Argentinians using this word before?

What we need to communicate is the same regardless of the language we use.\nIn this post I want to show you exactly how all languages are similar.\nLet’s dive straight to it, okay?\nSounds\nAll languages provide us with a set of sounds which carry meaning. Sometimes, they are so different from those of our native language that we feel lost or overwhelmed. Nonetheless, they are a system of articulated sounds that convey meaning.\nTenses\nMost languages have a way to link our words to the past, the present or the future. This is the whole point of tenses, you know? Then, of course, you can get yourself a cup of tea and look into Spanish with more detail and try to understand why there is such a wide variety of tenses. But for starters, keep this in mind.\nFormality and Informality\nMost languages have different words that are more appropriate in informal and formal contexts. You don’t use the same words and expressions to talk to people you know and people you don’t.\nLoanwords\nMost languages loan words from other languages. Spanish borrows quite a few words from the other Romance languages (French, Portuguese, Italian), as well as from English\nGender\nIn some languages, like Spanish, nouns are considered either feminine or masculine. In Spanish, nouns have to agree with adjectives and articles, so that may make it look more scary than languages which don’t mess things up with gender.\nSyntax\nThe relationship between words in a sentence is not arbitrary. You can’t just combine words in any order you like. You need to stick to word order. Spanish is not particularly strict with this, but there are things you just can’t do. Patterns in general, and syntax patterns in particular are incredibly helpful for your overall progress.\nAffirmation and Negation\nIt’s not all about affimative statements, sometimes we need to say “no”. Spanish is quite simple, as you can turn an affirmative into negative sentence in virtually all tenses by just placing NO before the conjugated verb.\nCertainty or Likelihood\nIn all languages there’s some device that will enable speakers to show if they are certain (how certain they are) or not.\nMorphemes\nYou can make a verb from a noun by attaching the right suffix. You can turn an adjective into its opposite by words from smaller units called morphemes. Take a look at\nTHIS POST\nto learn a great way to boost your vocabulary..\nI was chatting to\nCHAT GPT\nthe other day, discussing some of my ideas for this post (seriously), and I asked which languages  stray off the rules, and I learned that:\nSome languages, such as Chinese and Vietnamese, do not have a system of tenses. Instead, they rely on other means of expressing time, such as adverbs or context, to indicate when an event is occurring.\nSome languages, such as Korean and Japanese, do not have a concept of gender. Instead, they use other means of indicating the gender of a person, such as suffixes or honorifics.\nSome languages, such as Hawaiian and some Native American languages, do not have a system of singular and plural nouns. Instead, they rely on context or other means to indicate the number of objects being referred to.\nSome languages, such as Chinese, Thai and some African languages, have a tonal system, in which the pitch of a syllable can change the meaning of a word. This is not a feature that is present in many other languages.\nUntil next time,\nThanks for reading,\nNext Post »\n¿Me estás tomando el pelo? ¿Me estás jodiendo? ¿Me estás cargando?\nPrevious Post »\nChange the language in your devices!\nYou might also want to read these articles:\nThe Paradox of Choice\nToday, I want to introduce the concept of paradox of choice, and show you how it’s detrimental to your progress.\nArgentinian Spanish Input (part 1)\nIn this post, I included podcasts you can try to leverage your learning with natural input.\nEl que te jedi\nLearn a fun way of saying you-know-who in Rioplatense Spanish.\nInfumable\nHave you heard Argentinians using this word before?

One of them, the preference of Pretérito Indefinido over Pretérito Perfecto Compuesto, has already been covered\nHERE\n.\nThe other is the future tense.\nThe futuro simple tense, is used to express future actions or events that will occur some time in the future. It is formed by using the infinitive form of the verb and adding the appropriate ending, which varies depending on the subject of the sentence.\nFor example,\n“Viajaré” (I will travel),\n“Mañana lloverá” (Tomorrow it will rain),\n“Decidiremos el mes que viene” (We will decide next month).\nThe periphrastic future, on the other hand, is formed by using the correct form of the verb IR in the present tense, followed by the preposition “a”, plus the infinitive form of the main verb. And believe me, it’s almost all you’ll hear us using.\nFor example, instead of saying any of the three examples above, we would say\n“Voy a viajar” (I am going to travel),\n“Mañana va a llover” (It’s going to rain),\n“Vamos a decidir el mes que viene” (We are going to decide next month).\nThis simple adjustment will make your Spanish sound much more Argentinian. So, my advice is that you default to [IR] A + INFINITIVE or at least expect much more of it than simple future.\nIt’s as simple as that. And IR A + INF is arguably easier to incorporate than the future forms.\nGood luck!\nHappy Spanish learning,\nNext Post »\nMoney talk in Argentina\nPrevious Post »\nForget about Pretérito Perfecto Compuesto in Argentinian Spanish\nYou might also want to read these articles:\nThe Paradox of Choice\nToday, I want to introduce the concept of paradox of choice, and show you how it’s detrimental to your progress.\nArgentinian Spanish Input (part 1)\nIn this post, I included podcasts you can try to leverage your learning with natural input.\nEl que te jedi\nLearn a fun way of saying you-know-who in Rioplatense Spanish.\nInfumable\nHave you heard Argentinians using this word before?

These type of words are really interesting to look at. They don’t exist in isolation, but rather they make partnerships with others to maximize their reach.\nLook at these interesting examples:\nSer un manija\nCompré 6 vinos, 10 cervezas y un whisky para llevar al asado en lo de Emi. Soy un manija, ya sé.\nLet’s address a basic and infamous difference between SER and ESTAR. If you say “soy un MANIJA”, it’s something that has to do with your essence. You’re exaggerated by nature.\nEstar manija [con algo]\nEstoy manija con el viaje. Quiero que sea ya.\nOn the other hand, when you say “estoy MANIJA” it means you are excited about something that will take place soon.\nSometimes, with the possibility of something happening.\nQuedarse manija\nQuiero saber qué pasa en la próxima temporada. Me quedé re manija.\nMost often, we use the past tense to express that we were left with great interest. We want to know how something will turn out.\nTener una manija\nMañana me voy de vacaciones. Tengo una manija terrible.\nThis use is somehow similar to “estar MANIJA”. It means you’re excited about something.\nDarse manija / Manijearse\nAs a reflexive verb or accompanied by darse it’s usually heard in two ways:\nFirst, as a suggestion:\nNo te des manija\nNo te manijees\nAnd then, as a continuous periphrasis\nTe estás dando mucha manija\nSe está dando mucha manija\nSe están dando mucha manija\nManijear\nManijear would be to act on someone to make him anxious or excited.\nYo no quería ir, pero Luli me manijeó y bueno, al final dije que sí.\nThat’s all for today, amigos.

I thought some of you might feel at a loss when it comes to watching Argentinian movies, so I took some time to summarize the plot of some of the best and most recent ones that you could go for.\nIf you check the posters, you’ll find some repeated faces, namely those of Guillermo Francella, Ricardo Darín, probably the best known Argentinian actors at this moment.\nHope you take some inspiration from this list!\nLa extorsión\n(2023)\nIn “La extorsión” Alejandro Petrossian, an experienced commercial pilot is forced to collaborate with Argentinian intelligence services to avoid being punished for a serious fault he committed on the job. He is quickly plunged into an underworld of intrigue and extortion that will put his life at risk.\nArgentina, 1985\n(2022)\nThe film follows the Trial of the Juntas, the 1985 trial of members of the military government that ruled Argentina between 1976 and 1983. Interesting to get a gist of this very recent part of our history,\nEl robo del siglo\n(2020)\n“El robo del siglo” is based on the true story of the Banco Río heist that took place in Argentina in 2006. The film follows a group of ordinary men who meticulously plan and execute an audacious bank robbery, aiming to steal millions of dollars without harming anyone. Led by a mastermind and fueled by their individual motivations, the group carries out a complex heist, outsmarting the authorities and capturing the attention of the entire country. As the heist unfolds, tensions rise, relationships are tested, and unexpected twists arise.\nMy favorite in this list.\nLa odisea de los giles\n(2019)\n“La odisea de los giles” is a comedic heist film set in a small rural town in Argentina during the economic crisis of 2001. The film follows a group of neighbors who come together to carry out a plan to recover their savings after being swindled by a corrupt bank manager. Faced with various obstacles and challenges, the group of unlikely heroes embarks on a risky adventure that tests their resilience, ingenuity, and friendship. With a blend of humor and social commentary, the film explores themes of community solidarity, justice, and the resilience of ordinary people in the face of adversity.\nMi obra maestra\n(2018)\n“Mi obra maestra” is a comedy-drama that centers around the unlikely friendship between Arturo Silva, a charismatic but struggling artist, and Renzo Nervi, a cunning art gallery owner. Arturo, an eccentric and unconventional painter, finds himself at a creative impasse, while Renzo is desperate to revive his failing career. In an attempt to gain recognition and financial success, the duo hatches a plan to create a fraudulent masterpiece.\nAnimal\n(2018)\n“Animal” is a psychological thriller that delves into the mind of Antonio Decoud, a successful family man who begins to lose his grip on reality. Antonio becomes increasingly obsessed with an elusive white wolf that he believes is stalking him and his family. As his paranoia intensifies, Antonio’s behavior becomes more erratic and dangerous, causing strain on his relationships and pushing him to the brink of sanity.\nEl ciudadano ilustre\n(2016)\n“El ciudadano ilustre” tells the story of Daniel Mantovani, a renowned Argentine writer living in Europe who receives an invitation to return to his hometown. Reluctantly, he accepts the invitation and revisits the small town that inspired his successful novels. As he reconnects with his past and the people of the town, Daniel’s visit becomes a journey of self-reflection and exploration of the complexities of fame, art, and personal identity. The film offers a witty and satirical commentary on the relationship between artists and their roots, as well as the clash between personal desires and societal expectations.\nEl Clan\n(2015)\n“The Clan” is based on the true story of the Puccio family, who operated a kidnapping and murder ring in 1980s Buenos Aires. The film focuses on the sinister dynamics within the family as they carry out their crimes while maintaining a façade of respectability in their community.\nRelatos Salvajes\n(2014)\n“Relatos Salvajes” is an anthology film consisting of six darkly humorous and twisted stories that explore themes of revenge, justice, and human behavior. Each story presents a different scenario where characters, driven to their limits, unleash their wildest instincts.\nVino para robar\n(2013)\nPájaros Volando\n(2010)\n“Vino para robar” is a crime comedy that follows the story of Sebastián, a young man who dreams of becoming a sommelier. When Sebastián’s dreams are shattered after a failed wine tasting competition, he decides to take matters into his own hands. Along with his friends, including a hacker and a skilled thief, Sebastián plans an audacious heist to steal the most valuable bottle of wine in Argentina.\n“Pájaros volando” is a musical comedy that takes place in a fictional dystopian future. The film follows the story of a group of misfits and outcasts who form a band called “The Blowers.” Led by a charismatic and eccentric musician named Rodolfo, they embark on a journey to escape the oppressive city and find their freedom in the countryside. Along the way, they encounter a variety of peculiar characters and face challenges that test their resilience and friendship.\nEl secreto de sus ojos\n(2009)\nThis crime drama revolves around a retired legal counselor who decides to write a novel about an unsolved rape and murder case he worked on 25 years ago. As he revisits the past, the counselor becomes entangled in a web of memories, love, and justice. The film skillfully combines elements of mystery, romance, and political commentary, showcasing the complexities of Argentina’s recent history.\nEl hombre de al lado\n(2009)\n“El hombre de al lado” is a drama that explores the complexities of human relationships and social boundaries. The film revolves around Leonardo, an esteemed designer and architect, whose life is disrupted when a peculiar neighbor, Víctor, builds a window that overlooks Leonardo’s backyard. The construction leads to a conflict between the two men, escalating into a battle over privacy, aesthetics, and personal values.\nMake sure you check my article on\nLearning Spanish with movies\nDo you have others to recommend that I missed?

One of them addresses the contradiction between sedentarism and learning. Here it is:\n“We hear all the time that before getting any physical exercise we must warm up. Unless we do, we risk ourselves to suffer serious injuries, right? Well, the same is true before doing any mental work. We need to get active just as if we were to practise sports.\nJust because you are about to do mental work, it doesn’t mean you have to forget about your body. Our brain –especially when we are doing mental work– likes to trick us into believing that our body is just the shell within which our thoughts sail freely.\nSo, here is the deal: Take five minutes before the class, or any sort of practice session, and get your heart pumping a little faster than normally. Jump in place, do some push-ups, stretch your legs,\nmove your arms. Anything goes as long as it makes your heart beat a little faster than it was a minute ago.\nIn line with this, another myth we tend to keep alive is that when we are studying, we must remain seated.\nThis alleged principle is not as true as it appears to be: You should take mental breaks while keeping physically active.\nPlus, there are many ways in which you can move + practice your language simultaneously. For example, you could go out for a walk and listen to a podcast, a song, a recording in Spanish, or just keep a steady pace while you try to make an imaginary conversation with the things you’ve learn so far. Say it out loud. It’s much more effective. Even when it might seem awkward, it’s just a matter of habit.\nWhy don’t you try these ideas and tell me later how it goes? I don’t stick to them strictly, but I apply it when I start to feel I need a change of gear.”\nLearning Insights #7\nToday I came across a Jim Kwik video where he recommends juggling as a way of taking mental breaks. I really liked something he says: “Sitting is the new smoking”. But more than that, I loved that he suggests juggling as a great way of taking some time off and give your brain some time to rest. Information-packed video:\nHope it helps you stay more focused and make your learning more effective,\nGood luck!\nNext Post »\nPeople you don’t know by their name\nPrevious Post »\nSame, but not quite\nYou might also want to read these articles:\nThe Paradox of Choice\nToday, I want to introduce the concept of paradox of choice, and show you how it’s detrimental to your progress.\nArgentinian Spanish Input (part 1)\nIn this post, I included podcasts you can try to leverage your learning with natural input.\nEl que te jedi\nLearn a fun way of saying you-know-who in Rioplatense Spanish.\nInfumable\nHave you heard Argentinians using this word before?

Nowadays you’ll barely hear the younger generations using words like ‘sorprendido’, ‘exagerado’, but instead FLASH has taken over.\nIt is a clearly an English word, but the way we use it has nothing to do with the word meaning.\nEs un flash\nWhen we experience something extraordinary or very good, we say “es un flash”. For example:\n-¿Qué onda Japón, amigo? ¿Está bueno?\n-Es un flash, boludo. No lo podés creer. Todo es re diferente.\nOcassionally, it can be ‘¡Qué flash!’ as a reaction:\n-Y en un restaurante que fuimos, todos los camareros estaban vestidos de samurai.\n-Guau, ¡qué flash!\nFlashear\nAs a verb, flashear has two separate meanings. One, with the meaning of exaggerate and another to lie. The phrase used is usually “No flashees”.\n-¿Qué onda si cae un satélite de esos que Elon Musk está tirando todos los días y hace un quilombo bárbaro?\n-No flashees, boludo.\nWe usually ask questions like:\n-¿Qué te flasheó de Japón?\n-Me flasheó la comida.\nFlashero\nFlashero can be used in the expression ‘¡Qué flashero!’ like ‘Qué flash’, but it can also be used as an adjective, SER un flashero. It means you aim big.\n-Este Elon es un re flashero. Se le ocurre cada cosa al chabón…\nWith a pejorative meaning, it can be brought to its diminutive form:\n-Sí, pero es medio flasherito\n.

Just as actors immerse themselves in their roles to effectively convey emotions and intentions, as language learners you can benefit from adopting a similar mindset.\nLet me state my case.\nFeel what you’re saying\nThe standard at which we calibrate our\nforeign language speaking persona\nhas a huge impact on how we sound in terms of fluency. If you don’t feel comfortable using your target language, it’ll be in the air, so to speak.\nObviously, before you feel what you’re saying it’s essential that you understand what you’re saying, but very frequently a student knows the words and\nforgets\nto attach an intention to them or underestimates its overall importance.\nEvery day interactions leaving out all type of\ninterjections\nin conversation automatically lose their authenticity. You’d never have a conversation in your L1 that flat.\nSpeaking of that, the Argentinian Spanish Phrasebook can be a really helpful guy in your quest:\nSign up to the newsletter and download your FREE Argentinian Spanish Phrasebook!\nCLICK HERE\nStage fright\nNext, there’s the question of stage fright. Of course, stage fright is just as real when you’re a language learner. The fear of making mistakes and the anxiety of being right or misunderstood can put unnecessary spanners in the works.\nAcknowledging that making mistakes is an inevitable aspect of the learning journey enables you to shed your self-consciousness and focus on the joy of connecting with others through your target language.\nSome time ago I recommended\ncold practice\nas a way to deal with this as well as possible.\nEnjoy the ride, my friend!\nAccent and pronunciation\nLearning  a language, but specially picking up an accent is an imitation game. You may or may not have heard about SHADOWING, but in case you haven’t let me tell you this: shadowing has to do with impersonating the speaker you’re listening to. Following their exact pronunciation, rhythm, intonation and word stress. I also discussed this in my article on\nLearning Spanish with podcasts\n.\nIn order to do a good shadowing practice, you need to get in the skin of your language model. Otherwise you’ll miserably fail at it.\nThis side of any foreign language is far more relevant if you have an intermediate or advanced level in your L2. When you’re a beginner it’s much more important to focus on what’s been said above in this article and leave this for later.\nNever forget you’re crafting your Spanish speaking self.\nConnecting your words to the emotions involved is your most natural way of being in your native language, so why shouldn’t it in your target language? We can all embody it.\nHope this helps,\nGood luck in your Spanish learning!\nNext Post »\nFLASH, FLASHEAR, FLASHERO and FLASHERITO\nPrevious Post »\nHow to get fluent in Spanish?\nYou might also want to read these articles:\nThe Paradox of Choice\nToday, I want to introduce the concept of paradox of choice, and show you how it’s detrimental to your progress.\nArgentinian Spanish Input (part 1)\nIn this post, I included podcasts you can try to leverage your learning with natural input.\nEl que te jedi\nLearn a fun way of saying you-know-who in Rioplatense Spanish.\nInfumable\nHave you heard Argentinians using this word before?

In Argentina you really don’t need PPC at all, so forget about those time markers you’ve been struggling to memorize. It all funnels to PI.\nI know that for many students, referring to tenses by their name makes them shiver, but I insist that knowing the tenses by their name is like knowing the name of your friends.\nLet’s make clear who is who:\nPresente Perfecto Compuesto\nPPC\n– the auxiliary verb HABER plus a past participle (which can be a regular -ado/-ido participle, or an irregular one)\n[haber] + participle\nh\ne aprendido, has visto, hemos comprado, han hecho, etc.\nPretérito Indefinido\nPI\n– the verb is either regular or irregular. There isn’t really much too say in general terms about PI, as there are many different types of verb conjugations.\naprendí, viste, compramos, me compré, hicieron, etc.\nLet’s break it down a little further, okay?\nAccording to Spanish grammar, the typical uses of PPC have to do with:\nExperience\n. The PPC refers to a past experience without stating when they took place.\nContinuation\n. The PPC links some present state to a prior situation. This often has to do with the time phrase that wraps the event or story. Some of such phrases are:\núltimamente\neste último tiempo\nsiempre\nnunca\nalguna vez\nhoy\nesta mañana\neste año\nPI, on the other hand, should be used to refer to situations that belong to the past and are disconnected from the present time:\nel año pasado\nayer\nhace 2 horas\nla última vez\nanoche\nHowever, we ignore this guideline and insist with PI, regardless of the time phrase at stake.\nLook at this chart. This is a helpful contrast that shows the phrase in English and how we would phrase it in RPS (Rioplatense Spanish). Notice that it’s sometimes the verb and not the tense what defines the outcome:\nin English\nTurns to\nAR Spanish\nI’ve lived\nI’ve worked\nPresente indicativo\nVivo\nTrabajo\nI’ve been waiting\nI’ve been working\nPerífrasis [estar] + gerundio\nEstoy esperando\nEstoy trabajando\nI’ve been thinking\nI’ve been trying\nPerífrasis [estar] + gerundio\nEstuve pensando\nEstuve intentando\nI said we never use it, but you know that in language learning never is a relative word. PPCmay still occasionally be used, and may be found in writing and in formal speeches (presidents, for example, like to make use of it). But the important think to remember here is that compared to Peninsular Spanish, things here are quite differet.\nAll in all, these have not been such bad news, have they?\nSee you next time!\nHappy Spanish learning\nNext Post »\nForget about Futuro Simple in Argentina\nPrevious Post »\nInterjections\nYou might also want to read these articles:\nThe Paradox of Choice\nToday, I want to introduce the concept of paradox of choice, and show you how it’s detrimental to your progress.\nArgentinian Spanish Input (part 1)\nIn this post, I included podcasts you can try to leverage your learning with natural input.\nEl que te jedi\nLearn a fun way of saying you-know-who in Rioplatense Spanish.\nInfumable\nHave you heard Argentinians using this word before?

I clicked and immediately got hooked. I’d seen other videos like his, but these are somewhat different and totally gripping.\nAnd his channel has been growing exponentially over the past few months thanks to that.\nHis game is rhetoric. Some of them are dedicated to reacting to famous speeches while others, which are more relevant for us language learners, focus on how to be more articulate.\nBeing articulate is not something that I would literally translate into Spanish as “articulado”, but nonetheless it makes sense to think it that way. It makes me think of those action figures you play with as a child —muñecos articulados. Only that the movements of those action figures are more stiff than I’d like my language skills to be.\nAnyways, what I like about him is that he offers actionable strategies to be a better communicator. So, although he does not speak from the standpoint of a language learner, most of what he says can be applied to language learning.\nIn one of the first few videos I watched before bingeing a handful of them (see it embedded below), he offers 5 steps to speak like you think:\n1. Focus on the three M’s of communication: me, message, and messenger\n2. Focus on the intention and purpose of communication\n3. Practice active listening and empathy\n4. Embrace vulnerability and authenticity\n5. Practice consistently and seek feedback\nAnd these pieces of advice happen to be finely entangled to what we want to achieve as language learners. Of course, since he’s not mentoring students of a foreign language, he doesn’t refer to those type of skills, but I can do that to supplement the already powerful message contained in the video.\nIn short, what you want, first and foremost, is to feel comfortable with using your target language. How do you get there? Well, there’re many alternative paths, but what they all have in common is the realization that the most essential ingredient is consistent dedication and embracing mistakes.\nYou have to go past the initial liking of the idea of speaking Spanish, and actually get your hands dirty, while feeling happy with that. Do not face it as a daily struggle, else you’ll fail.\nYou need to feel uncomfortable in order to then feel comfortable. You need to accept that it’s not easy until it feels easier (notice I didn’t say easy, but easier). This is why learning and honing a skill is so exciting!\nAnd that’s where it gets personal. Nobody can tell you what to do. At most, those who have some experience can tell you what you\ncould\ndo.\nNowadays we are so used to ready made meals that we expect everything to work in that way.\nYou’ve proably heard it before: If you want to succeed, fail first. Fail again, fail better.\nHappy Spanish learning,\nNext Post »\nArgentinian Series to brush up on your Porteño Spanish\nPrevious Post »\nWhat does ZARPADO mean in Argentinian Spanish?\nYou might also want to read these articles:\nThe Paradox of Choice\nToday, I want to introduce the concept of paradox of choice, and show you how it’s detrimental to your progress.\nArgentinian Spanish Input (part 1)\nIn this post, I included podcasts you can try to leverage your learning with natural input.\nEl que te jedi\nLearn a fun way of saying you-know-who in Rioplatense Spanish.\nInfumable\nHave you heard Argentinians using this word before?

Have you been wondering what is the connection between Argentina Spanish and Italian? Let me try to shed some light on the matter.\nItalian immigrants\nStarting in the 1880s and until the 1920s, Argentina received a massive immigration wave from European countries, namely Spain and Italy. The latter brought over their own dialects. Among the Italian varieties, Genovese is thought to have had the greatest influence on Porteño Spanish.\nLet’s stop here for a minute and answer the initial question. Argentinian Spanish and Italian are both Romance languages, which means that they both evolved from Latin. However, they are distinct languages with their own unique grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation. They are not mutually intelligible, meaning that speakers of one language would not be able to understand speakers of the other language without prior knowledge or study.\nItalian influence on AR Spanish\nThe influence of Italian in Argentinian Spanish, however, is undeniable. Most people who know Italian but don’t know Spanish would feel that ‘Argentines are Italians who speak Spanish’. The prosody of Italian is evident in our language. There are similarities in the pronunciation of some words and phrases between the two languages, particularly in the intonation and stress patterns. This can make them sound similar to foreign ears.\nThe cultural similarities between Italy and Argentina, such as the love for music, dance, soccer and food, can also contribute to the perception of similarity between the two languages.\nDue to its large Italian diaspora, there are many words borrowed from Italian into the Argentinian Spanish. Today, Italianisms permeate everyday language. In fact,\nLUNFARDO\n(Argentinian slang) has been influenced and modeled by Italian more than by any other language.\nLet’s take a look at the following list of loanwords from Italian to Argentinian Spanish:\nLABURO | LABURAR\n– work – to work\nY, ¿cómo viene el laburo?\nMi viejo empezó a laburar a los 15 años.\nPIBE/PIBA\n– boy/girl\nAlejo es un pibe raro.\nMORFAR\n– to eat\nChe, ¿morfamos algo?\nFANGOTE\n– a great amount of something\nUn fangote de guita.\nFESTICHOLA\n– party\nEl sábado se armó una festichola bárbara en la casa de mi vecino.\nMATINA\n– the morning\nEstoy fusilado. Hoy me tuve que levantar a las 6 de la matina y no paré en todo el día.\nCUALUNQUE\n– of no particular merit\nMe compré una silla de escritorio medio cualunque, y ya me estoy arrepintiendo.\nFALOPA\n– drug\nHoy en día hay mucha falopa en la calle.\nFACHA | FACHERO\n– good look | handsome\n¡Qué facha tenés con esos anteojos, che!\nFIACA\n– lazyness\nTengo una fiaca hoy…\nBIRRA\n– beer\n¿Nos tomamos una birra?\nESCABIO | ESCABIAR\n– an alcoholic drink | drink an alcoholic drink\nLuis le da bastante al escabio.\nPará de escabiar que te vas a dar vuelta, amigo.\nCAPO\n– very skilled | also used to address an unknown man in the street.\nMartín es un capo con los números.\nCapo, ¿me decís la hora?\nCHANTA\n– an untrustworthy person\nNo le creas nada de lo que te dice, Mario es un chanta.\nSALAME\n– a foolish person. We usually use this word to avoid using BOLUDO.\n¡Qué salame! Me olvidé la billetera en mi casa.\nMUFA\n– bad luck or bad mood\nMe parece que Ramiro es medio mufa.\n¡No te mufes, che, era un chiste!\nCHICATO\n– short-sighted\nComo soy bastante chicato, sin anteojos no leo nada\n.\nGAMBA\n– the leg. Meter la gamba means to make a mistake.\nSí, ya sé, metí la gamba. Perdón.\nMINA\n– woman\nMiriam es una mina muy trabajadora.\nWhile I researched for this post, I learnt that words like chicato, chanta and escabio were of Italian origins. Languages are marvelous creatures, indeed.\nI recommend you take a look at\nthis article\n, too.

The expression conveys with astounding mathematical precision that they’re struggling with that skill, or sometimes that you’ll struggle before you start to see the results confirming our efforts are paying off.\nI like that we call it a curve and not a line. As you probably know, the line is a manmade creation. It’s an artificial thing that you won’t fin in nature. Calling it a curve we’re acknowledging the processs of learning is non-linear.\nPerhaps it makes more sense to call it the learning doodle, as we get lost, stray, and get back on track, only to find ourselves hopeless.\nHowever, I feel there’s a chance that we don’t fully understand the implications and still expect our progress to replicate the all-too-famous straight line from zero to hero.\nYou probably know false expectations are deadly, and setting off to learn a language expecting your journey to be like that will only leave you disappointed. Instead, you should be ready beforehand for the the stumbles and falls involved in learning a foreign language.\nSkills have a learning rhythm\nIn short, there are\nfour stages of competence\n:\nUnconscious incompetence\n(I don’t know I don’t know)\nConscious incompetence\n(I know I don’t know)\nConscious competence\n(I’m learning and getting better)\nUnconscious competence\n(The skill I was learning has become second nature)\nHow does this fourfold road map help? Well, it provides us with valuable insights into our learning. All starts in the dark, and gradually becomes clearer. It’s unnatural to expect phase 4 when we’ve not taken a single step, as it is to think that being soaked in confidence will make up for all we don’t know.\nBringing this framework to language learning, phase 1 is difficult to imagine, as most people who don’t speak Spanish clearly know they don’t. But don’t forget that on stage 1 they don’t know they don’t know. What we have on phase 1 is people who’ve been learning for a relatively short time but are in the height of their romance with the language.\nThen something comes to show they have gaps in their abilities. Perhaps a specific interaction or situation triggers this frustrating experience. It’s time to put some conscious effort into the matter.\nThis is where they actively work on improving their language skills. While structured study and practice are essential, it’s also a phase where learners discover their individual learning preferences. Some may excel through immersion and real-life practice, while others benefit from more structured methods.\nIt’s at this stage that learners often discover their own unique approaches to language acquisition. They might explore various learning resources, experiment with different methods, and find what works best for them personally. This phase can involve a degree of trial and error as learners figure out their optimal strategies.\nEventually, phase 4 can be devised in the distance. If they continue to push forward, it’ll become a reality. Most probably, reaching this stage is the ultimate goal for language learners, but it often takes time and consistent practice.\nAt this stage, learners can use the language fluently and naturally without conscious effort. Conversations flow smoothly, and they can understand and respond without needing to think about grammar rules or vocabulary.\nBut even at that stage, you need to stay with it, like you would in a beautiful garden of colorful flowers that have just bloomed. (The Barroque got me there)\nEmbrace the entirety of your language learning journey, from the initial romance with the language to the more challenging phases of conscious effort. Understand that progress is non-linear, and each stage has its unique value. Stay committed, stay curious, and enjoy the process.\nThere’s another curve I’d like to discuss sometime soon, the forgetting curve.\nUntil next time,\nThanks for stopping by,\nNext Post »\nLa posta | La verdad de la milanesa = The truth\nPrevious Post »\nMandarse un moco | una cagada = To screw stg up\nYou might also want to read these articles:\nThe Paradox of Choice\nToday, I want to introduce the concept of paradox of choice, and show you how it’s detrimental to your progress.\nArgentinian Spanish Input (part 1)\nIn this post, I included podcasts you can try to leverage your learning with natural input.\nEl que te jedi\nLearn a fun way of saying you-know-who in Rioplatense Spanish.\nInfumable\nHave you heard Argentinians using this word before?

Easy, with the word DALE. It’s so ubiquitous that we’ve lost sight of all the different uses we put it to.\nIt’s actually one of the first words we learn to use in class.\nIn this post I’ll show you with several examples how to incorporate it to your Argentinian Spanish toolbox. Ready? In the following short dialogues you’ll see DALE in action.\nDALE like ‘okay’\n-Voy a averiguar y después te llamo.\n-Dale, gracias.\nDALE like ‘okay?’\n-Hola Mati, ¿podés hablar?\n-Estoy en clase. Te llamo a la noche, ¿dale?\n-Dale, dale. No hay apuro.\nDALE like ‘good idea’\n-Che, voy a pedir una pizza.\n-Dale. Yo quiero una porción de fainá también.\nDALE like ‘come on’\n-Dale che, salgamos que se hace tarde.\nDALE like ‘I agree to do that’\n-Vos comprá la bebida y nosotros compramos la comida, ¿te parece?\n-Dale, perfecto. Quedamos así.\nJust one thing: don’t use it to say ‘I understand’, in the way you can use ‘okay’. In those cases, stick to ‘Entiendo’.\nOver the last few years, DE UNA has been taking up more and more space. So now, a prototypical young Argentinian will alternatively answer:\n-Nos vemos mañana, ¿dale?\n-De una.\nor combine both:\n-Nos vemos mañana, ¿dale?\n-Dale, de una.\nIn Spain, the word of choice is VALE. That makes me think the change of the V for a D was another of the many consequences of the overseas voyage of Spanish through the Atlantic.\nSince you are here, I’m guessing you want to learn Argentine Spanish.

First, because their very nature is to specify characteristics of nouns. It allows you to give more information about a noun (person, place or thing), and there is so much to possibly say about nouns, right?\nBasically, a lack of rich adjectives to describe things, persons or places confront us with a sense of limited vocabulary. I think that’s why we read so many ‘greats’ and ‘bigs’ and ‘goods’. Our vocabulary for adjectives tends to be quite poor but made up for with\nverys\nor\nreallys\nor\nquites\n, that make them sound more sophisticated.\nIn Spanish, MEDIO is usually that type of word. It doesn’t bring much to the table, but it delivers that extra that you sometimes need to grade an adjective.\nYou can hear it in combinations where you’re trying to soften a negative adjective, such as:\nMedio caro\nMedio aburrido\nMedio peligroso\nMedio antipático\nMedio desubicado\nMedio berreta (this one means of bad quality)\nI think with these examples you can get the basic idea, and be ready when you next hear it.\nUntil next time, and thanks for reading!\nNext Post »\nArgentinian Spanish curse words\nPrevious Post »\nNo me cabe | No me copa = No me gusta\nYou might also want to read these articles:\nThe Paradox of Choice\nToday, I want to introduce the concept of paradox of choice, and show you how it’s detrimental to your progress.\nArgentinian Spanish Input (part 1)\nIn this post, I included podcasts you can try to leverage your learning with natural input.\nEl que te jedi\nLearn a fun way of saying you-know-who in Rioplatense Spanish.\nInfumable\nHave you heard Argentinians using this word before?

In this article I’ll show you how we use it in Argentina.\nAlso, I like that it’s formed with a typical\nVOS imperative form\nand the VOS pronoun, which makes it highly Argentinian.\nThere’re three main use cases:\nMIRÁ VOS as surprise\nWhen you hear a story from someone you can react with “mirá vos” when the person drops unexpected information. For example:\n-Esta es mi quinta vez en Argentina, estoy enamorada del país.\n-¡Mirá vos! ¡Qué bueno! Conocés el país mejor que unos cuantos.\nMIRÁ VOS as a demonstration of interest\nAlso, you can use “mirá vos” to show you are interested in what you’re hearing. For example:\n-En mi empresa trabajan varias personas que hablan español, así que trato de hablar con ellos.\n-Mirá vos, eso está bueno.\nMIRÁ VOS to express coincidence or lack of coincidence\nAnd the last use case is quite interesting, as it can be used to express both a coincidence or a lack of it. For example:\n-Soy de Pergamino\n-¡Mirá vos qué casualidad! Yo también\n-Me voy mañana a la mañana.\n-Ah, mirá vos, yo me voy esta noche.\nWell, I’ll leave you with mirá vos for the rest of the day.

Proof of this is the fact that it is part of so many expressions. Today I’ll be expanding on this local fascination for the word.\nDe culo\nIf you say you did stg “de culo”, it means you did it by chance, or that it happened by chance. For example:\nGanaron de culo, con un gol en contra en el último minuto.\nSe salvó de culo. Cruzó la calle como el orto.\nComo el culo\nOn the other hand, when you say “como el culo”, it means very badly. For example:\nMe fue como el culo en el trabajo hoy.\nLlevé mi teléfono al service la semana pasada y lo arreglaron como el culo, porque ya está andando mal.\nLa loma del culo\nLike I mentioned at the begininning, culo can be used to say something is very far, as in:\nSí, es un lugar precioso, pero está en la loma del culo.\nCULO and verbs\nCulo also likes to be part of verb phrases.\nTENER CULO\nto be lucky.\nTENER MÁS CULO QUE CABEZA\nto be more lucky than intelligent.\nTENER EL CULO SUCIO\nto be guilty in some way.\nSER UN CULO ROTO\nbe snobby.\nROMPERSE EL CULO\nto put a lot of effort into something.\nTENER CARA DE CULO\nto look angry or upset.\nLLEVARSE COMO EL CULO\nto not get along well with someone.\nCERRAR EL CULO\nIt’s used in imperative sentences, just like in ‘Shut the fuck up!’-\nCAERSE DE CULO\nto be surprised by something-\nMETERSE ALGO EN EL CULO\nto finally not put something to use.\nCULEAR\nit has two meanings. One, sexual, has to do with anal sex, but other applies when you pay too much for something.\nCULEADO\nIn Córdoba, guys use culea’o when talking informally to a friend.\nI think that’s most of the culo universe.

It’s used in the same way as we’d use\nto stand your ground\nin English.\nOriginally, it was heard when referring to the attitude of football fans when confronting the opposite team’s fan, usually in a violent fashion. Opposite gangs would try to steal each other’s flags as trophies, and that’s how the phrase possibly was born.\nWith time, it became more of a go-to expression when you’re maintaining a position (like never backing down/ never giving up) or alternatively, to being patient in difficult times.\nFor example, when I googled to find examples of the expression I found:\n“Hay que aguantar los trapos, lo económico es cuestión de tiempo.”\n“La mayoría de los empresarios de la provincia se ha puesto a disposición para aguantar los trapos.”\nSometimes, it’s just chopped off to aguantar.\nCool expression to know, I think.\nUntil next time!\nNext Post »\nA lot of work at the beginning\nPrevious Post »\nThe fluidity of CULO\nYou might also want to read these articles:\nThe Paradox of Choice\nToday, I want to introduce the concept of paradox of choice, and show you how it’s detrimental to your progress.\nArgentinian Spanish Input (part 1)\nIn this post, I included podcasts you can try to leverage your learning with natural input.\nEl que te jedi\nLearn a fun way of saying you-know-who in Rioplatense Spanish.\nInfumable\nHave you heard Argentinians using this word before?

{"url": "https://ventureoutspanish.com/use-authentic-reading-material/", "title": "How to use authentic reading material | Venture Out Spanish", "text": "How to use authentic reading material\nPost author:\nMatías\nPost published:\nNovember 16, 2022\nReading time:\n6 mins read\nThank you for sharing this post!\nShare this content\nOpens in a new window\nOpens in a new window\nOpens in a new window\nOpens in a new window\nOpens in a new window\nOpens in a new window\nMost would agree that one of the most significant achievements as a language learner is when you can face language in its real environment.\nIn the case of reading, usually we feel we are not prepared to do this straight away so we turn to adapted material in the hope of starting to gradually feel more and more confident about our skills until finally trying to transition from ‘adapted’ material to ‘real life’ material.\nOne day, we finally feel prepared, and when this happens the feeling is usually of frustration. Real life language –which is the one we REALLY want to understand from the beginning- is far less comprehensible than what we expected, so we convince themselves that we need to build up on our vocabulary or overall grammar knowledge before we can proceed any further.\nI’m here to tell you this should not be the case: You can start off right away with authentic materials, and you’ll have a great time.\nHowever, there are a few things that you should keep in mind to make it valuable and enjoyable:\n1#\nFind a reliable source for topics you’d like to read about. This is usually easier said than done, as it’s not always easy to find the right sources for your target language, so probably you’ll have to browse through the web a little. Once you find a source you are happy with, get the most out of it before moving on to another website. You should avoid biting off more than you can chew. Don’t binge read just for the sake of ‘reading a lot’. Don’t waste all the opportunities one single article gives you.\n2#\nGet yourself a translation of that article in your target language into your native language. There are different ways you can get the translation, but they require some sort of workarounds to get them. I recommend you\nIm translator\nas it allows you to translate any online text, and not just that… it allows you to create interlinear texts! Google it and you’ll find detailed step by step instructions on how to use it.\n3#\nIdeally, print out the text/s so you can work more comfortably.\nOnce these three steps are completed, it’s time to get down to work… but how?\nPatiently.\nWhen you use authentic material in a foreign language the procedure is quite different from what you do in your native language. Essentially because in our native language reading it once would be enough while in a foreign language it isn’t. You’ll read and read through your article several times. You want to take advantage of it by approaching it on different levels.\nOne more thing before we get any further into this: there are two layers to any type of text:\nThe layer of message or information and\nThe layer of language\nThe information you get from an article is wrapped up in the language the writer has used. Focus on getting the information first, and then move on to the language.\nSo, let’s get started:\nI\nUnless you are a complete beginner, read the article for the first time in your target language.*\nDon’t aim for too much this first time, just try to get the gist of it (a general idea about what it is about). One sentence or two are enough for now. Don’t worry about words you don’t know. Don’t focus on what you don’t understand, but in what you do.\nII\nRead the text in your native language.\nIII\nRead the text again in your target language.\nIV\nCompare both texts, trying to connect elements more precisely to your native language. Connect the dots, doing things like ‘[this word] is this verb in this tense’, ‘[this] is an adjective and it means [this]’. There is no fixed rule.\nV\nLook for patterns. Notice the most apparent/repetitive ones. 2 or 3 words groups (verb + preposition/adjective + preposition/ verb phrases/connectors + prepositions/etc). While we are on this subject, I would like to mention there are some cool text analytics that you can try. Ask me and I’ll show you.\nVI\nYou can now focus on mining phrases that you think you will be able to use again. Mining is a fancier word for gathering. The idea is to ‘steal’ blocks of language, not isolated words. Don’t aim for a full sentence, though, as it would be too long to remember.\n*In case you’ve just started learning the foreign language, start by reading the article in your native language first or you’ll be too lost.\nThis is officially the end of PHASE 1, but you could extend the activity:\nHave a native read and/or record the article, listen to it a few times paying attention to pronunciation and entonation.\nRead the article aloud\nRead aloud to a Google Doc. Google Docs have a feature by which you can turn speech to text and it’s a great opportunity to check how tuned your pronunciation is.\nHope you find these suggestions useful!\nLooking forward to your feedback!\nHappy Spanish learning!\nNext Post »\nFacts about Argentina (in Spanish)\nPrevious Post »\nThe language learning mindset\nYou might also want to read these articles:\nThe Paradox of Choice\nToday, I want to introduce the concept of paradox of choice, and show you how it’s detrimental to your progress.\nArgentinian Spanish Input (part 1)\nIn this post, I included podcasts you can try to leverage your learning with natural input.\nEl que te jedi\nLearn a fun way of saying you-know-who in Rioplatense Spanish.\nInfumable\nHave you heard Argentinians using this word before?

How would you define it?\nIn the world of film dubbing and television, the term neutral Spanish is commonly used to refer to a standardized form of the language aimed at reaching the widest audience possible. This variant of Spanish, characterized by its lack of regional accents or idiomatic expressions, has gained popularity through its use in dubbed movies and TV shows.\nHowever, it’s essential to understand that the concept of neutral Spanish is more of a convenience for dubbing purposes  than a linguistic reality. Language is inherently diverse and constantly evolving, shaped by cultural, historical, and regional influences. As such, the idea of a single, neutral form of Spanish overlooks the rich diversity within the Spanish-speaking world.\nThe Argentinian experience\nInterestingly enough, attempts to dub movies into Rioplatense Spanish have encountered challenges. Despite efforts to adapt the dialogue and cultural references to better resonate with local audiences, these dubbed versions have sometimes faced criticism for -paradoxically- feeling unnatural for the Argentinian audience.  It turns out that besides the accent being almost incompatible with body language, the Rioplatense accent is considered “the accent of Buenos Aires”, adding to the long dispute between Buenos Aires-Interior. This highlights the complexities involved in adapting content for specific linguistic and cultural contexts.\nA YouTube teacher made an excellent series of videos showing this:\nSpanish by Fede\nIn my experience as a Spanish teacher, I’ve encountered students who express a desire to learn the language but specify that they are not particularly interested in learning Argentinian Spanish. In such cases, I do my best to remove the most regional features of my speech, but still, I don’t think that can be considered neutral, but rather a hybrid.\nThat’s why my recommendation is that you choose an accent you like, and go down that road and see where it takes you. It will also narrow all the resources choices out there. And always be aware of what Spanish accent you expose yourself to.\nHappy Spanish learning,\nNext Post »\nPonerse a [alguien] en el bolsillo\nPrevious Post »\nA lot of work at the beginning\nYou might also want to read these articles:\nThe Paradox of Choice\nToday, I want to introduce the concept of paradox of choice, and show you how it’s detrimental to your progress.\nArgentinian Spanish Input (part 1)\nIn this post, I included podcasts you can try to leverage your learning with natural input.\nEl que te jedi\nLearn a fun way of saying you-know-who in Rioplatense Spanish.\nInfumable\nHave you heard Argentinians using this word before?

Hope you’re doing great!\nBack in the day, when I was learning English, one of the most powerful shifts I remember experiencing was when I switched from an English-Spanish dictionary to a English-English (aka monolingual) learners’ dictionary. It was a thick and intimidating paperback edition.\nNow, as a Spanish tutor, I want to share the power of staying monolingual with you. It’s not just about looking up words, it’s about immersing yourself in the language. Monolingual dictionaries aren’t just tools; they’re essential elements of immersion, guiding you on your journey to fluency and proficiency.\nIn this article, we’ll explore the advantages of staying monolingual.\nUnderstand language more deeply\nUsing a monolingual dictionary opens the door to a deeper understanding of the Spanish language. Instead of relying on translations, which can sometimes be imprecise or miss the nuances of meaning, a monolingual dictionary provides definitions, explanations, and examples in Spanish itself.\nBuild vocabulary\nWhen you use a monolingual dictionary, you not only learn the definition of a word but also find synonyms, antonyms, and related terms. This exposure to a diverse range of words and expressions expands your vocabulary in ways that transcend mere translation.\nDevelop language independence\nOne of the most valuable skills you can cultivate as a language learner is independence. Independence empowers you to navigate the complexities of the language on your own, without constantly relying on translations or external assistance. Using a monolingual dictionary is a powerful way to develop this independence in your Spanish learning journey.\nPractical Tips for Using Monolingual Dictionaries\nIt’s crucial to approach the use of a dictionary with some preparation, or mental warm up. These suggestions come to mind:\nStart with Simple Words\n: Begin by looking up simple, commonly used words in your monolingual dictionary. Pay attention to how the word is defined and used in example sentences to get a feel for its various meanings and contexts.\nUse Context Clues\n: When encountering an unfamiliar word in a text, try to infer its meaning from the surrounding context before consulting your monolingual dictionary. This will help you develop your ability to guess the meaning of words based on their context, a valuable skill in language learning.\nExplore Related Words\n: Don’t just focus on the main entry; take the time to explore related words, synonyms, antonyms, and idiomatic expressions associated with the word you’re looking up. This will broaden your vocabulary and deepen your understanding of how words are used in different contexts.\nPractice Regularly\n: Make using your monolingual dictionary a regular part of your language learning routine. The more you engage with Spanish definitions and examples, the more natural and intuitive it will become to navigate the language independently.\nBe Patient and Persistent\n: Learning to use a monolingual dictionary effectively takes time and practice. Be patient with yourself and don’t be discouraged by initial challenges. Stay persistent, and you’ll gradually become more confident and proficient in using your monolingual dictionary as a tool for language learning.\nRecommended dictionaries (the titles in bold are actionable)\nReal Academia Española (RAE) – Diccionario de la lengua española\n: This is the official dictionary of the Spanish language.\nDiccionario Panhispánico de Dudas (DPD)\n: A reference work published by the RAE and ASALE, providing authoritative guidance on Spanish language usage, spelling, grammar, and word usage across Spanish-speaking regions.\nWordReference\n: WordReference offers a robust online monolingual dictionary for Spanish learners. It provides definitions, examples, and discussions on word usage, along with a forum where users can ask questions and interact with other language learners or native speakers.\nEtimologías de Chile\n:\nThis is probably my own favorite. It’s a valuable resource focusing on the etymology of Spanish words. It provides detailed information about the origins and historical development of words, with insights into linguistic roots and historical context.\nDiccionario Argentino\n: As the title suggests, it’s a dictionary specifically oriented to Spanish terms common in Argentina.\nDiccionario de Partículas Discursivas\n: This one is one I really like. It gives you an incredible variety of discourse markers and lets you find the connectors in context.\nHope you find these resources useful in your journey to Spanish fluency!\nNext Post »\nA full | A pleno | De una = Sure thing\nPrevious Post »\nPEDO and its multiverse of meanings\nYou might also want to read these articles:\nThe Paradox of Choice\nToday, I want to introduce the concept of paradox of choice, and show you how it’s detrimental to your progress.\nArgentinian Spanish Input (part 1)\nIn this post, I included podcasts you can try to leverage your learning with natural input.\nEl que te jedi\nLearn a fun way of saying you-know-who in Rioplatense Spanish.\nInfumable\nHave you heard Argentinians using this word before?

Don’t be afraid to experiment. you have\nTHIS ARTICLE\nfor further reference.\nWRITE:\nWriting the word down helps create a personal connection with it. Physically engaging with the word through writing reinforces your memory, and the act of writing helps to anchor the word in your mind. Give the word some context, write it as you’ve discovered it or in any other way that helps you create a bond with it.\nHEAR:\nHearing the word used in various contexts and by different speakers enhances your understanding and familiarity with the word. It helps you recognize the word’s pronunciation, intonation, and usage nuances.\nYouGlish\nis a wonderful tool for this matter.\nSAY:\nSpeaking the word aloud is essential for getting the pronunciation right.

Well, my dear, this is the right place to learn about them. In this article I’ll walk you through a mouth-watering tour.\nFirst things first\nBut, hang on there.\nTo truly appreciate the deliciousness of Argentine facturas, we need to start at the beginning. The origins of these pastries can be traced back to the arrival of European immigrants to Argentina in the 19th century. These immigrants brought with them their baking traditions, including the art of making pastries.\nOver time, Argentine bakers put their own spin on these pastries, adding new flavors and shapes to create the beloved facturas that we know today.\nAnarchism and Facturas\nA curious side of facturas is that many of them have a provocative name, targetting the government, the military and the church. This is due to the fact that many bakers were anarchists and saw an opportunity in modeling their pastries to mock their ‘enemies’.\nThis explains why you find facturas with such names as vigilantes (referring to the police), sacramentos (sacraments), bolas de fraile (friar’s balls) and cañoncitos (little cannons).\nTypes of facturas\nNow, let’s take a look at them There are many different varieties to choose from, each with its own unique flavor and texture.\nIf you’re new to Argentine facturas, the names of the different varieties can be a bit confusing. Here’s a handy inventory of the most popular ones:\nChurro\n: Fried dough that’s crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The classic churro is filled with dulce de leche. Only for the brave.\nMedialuna de manteca\n: Half-moon shaped pastry, similar to a croissant.\nMedialuna de grasa\n: If you compare the two types of medialuna in the picture above, you’ll see that this one is thinner and savory.\nSacramento\n: Usually filled with quince jam.\nHuevo frito\n: New to me under that name, but I can clearly see why the name. Dulce de leche and crema pastelera in sweet composition.\nMoñito\n: Another with a visible justification for the name. Either quince jam or crema pastelera on the extremes.\nVigilante\n: Rectangular pastry with stripes of quince jam or crema pastelera on top.\nLengüitas\n: Elongated pastries, with quince jam or crema pastelera on top.\nTortita negra\n: Self descriptive. Round pastries, covered with black sugar.\nBola de fraile\n: You can find these pastries either filled with dulce de leche or crema pastelera.\nCañoncito\n: Long, cylindrical pastry filled with lots of dulce de leche.\nOther species in the bakery ecosystem\nAs if all this were not enough, you can find other delicious treats in traditional bakeries. Some of the most common are\nBizcochitos\n: Small, round. It can be either sweet (sugar coated) or savory.\nPalmeritas\n: Really can’t say why they got this name. They have a funny shape, but certainly not that of a palm tree.\nCremonas\n: Like a reddit user explains, it’s a bread made with a lot of butter in the shape of a circle, or crown if you would.\nA\npodcast episode\non FACTURAS is in the pipeline.

In other dialects of Spanish “la chusma” has a different meaning that is not used in Argentina.\nCHISMOSO\n– adjective – if things worked consistently, it would make more sense to have the word chusmoso, but well, you know that’s not usually the case.\nCHISME\n– noun – gossip\nCHIMENTO\n– noun – somewhat the same as CHISME.

Because I think audio and transcripts are incredibly beneficial for increasing your vocabulary and improving your pronunciation in the most natural way possible.\nREAD:\nHow to learn Spanish with podcasts?\nWhile it’s true it only takes time for anything to turn a year, Traé Alfajores is by now a central part of the identity of Venture Out.

It’s much easier than you think!\nKeep in mind that natural and effective communication is at the basis of any language learning journey.\nThe mechanics of Authentic Interaction\nIn the Authentic Interaction approach, we focus on using the words and phrases you’d normally use in your native language (NL). This does not mean translating the phrase from English to Spanish literally, but rather keeping the tone and idea in your target language (TL).\nFor example, once you know “Let me know” translates as “Avisame”, you’ll never say “Dejame saber”. Hundreds of mistakes by transference can be avoided in this way!\nThe key to success with this method is to shift our mindset from overthinking each word to focusing on language chunks or phrases. These language chunks are like building blocks that allow us to express ourselves fluently and naturally. You’ll find that conversations flow more smoothly when you master these chunks rather than getting stuck on individual words.\nUsing a personal Phrasebook\nTo make the most of the Authentic Interaction approach, I recommend keeping a personalized phrasebook. I’ve put together a comprehensive phrasebook file with dozens of essential phrases and expressions you’ll commonly use in everyday situations. This phrasebook covers many functional uses of the language, from expressing agreement/disagreemente to answering questions.\nPlus, it’s based on Rioplatense Spanish, not on any other shady dialect locals would never use.\nThe best part? You can access and download this phrasebook for FREE! It’s my gift to you as a subscriber of Venture Out. By joining, you’ll receive monthly updates to help you along your language learning journey.\nSign up to the newsletter and download your FREE Argentinian Spanish Phrasebook!\nCLICK HERE\nTalk soon,\nHappy Spanish learning!\nNext Post »\nHow to get fluent in Spanish?\nPrevious Post »\nMy curated list of Argentinian movies (2023)\nYou might also want to read these articles:\nThe Paradox of Choice\nToday, I want to introduce the concept of paradox of choice, and show you how it’s detrimental to your progress.\nArgentinian Spanish Input (part 1)\nIn this post, I included podcasts you can try to leverage your learning with natural input.\nEl que te jedi\nLearn a fun way of saying you-know-who in Rioplatense Spanish.\nInfumable\nHave you heard Argentinians using this word before?

Some aspects can actually be deceitful, but hey, Rome wasn’t built in a day.\nThe most important thing is to stay in the game. So, don’t ever let negative thoughts grow in your mind.

{"url": "https://ventureoutspanish.com/a-lot-of-work-at-the-beginning/", "title": "A lot of work at the beginning | Venture Out Spanish", "text": "A lot of work at the beginning\nPost author:\nMatías\nPost published:\nJanuary 20, 2024\nReading time:\n6 mins read\nThank you for sharing this post!\nShare this content\nOpens in a new window\nOpens in a new window\nOpens in a new window\nOpens in a new window\nOpens in a new window\nOpens in a new window\nLearning a language is a lot of work at the beginning, nobody who’s experienced it will dispute that. Your brain is challenged with hundreds of simultaneous tasks, doing acrobatics with vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation all at once.\nWhen I’m inducting beginner students I see this all the time, and it’s not always a comfortable experience for them. Nonetheless, it’s a wonderful moment in our learning.\nThis month I came back to the drums after several years, and even rusty as I am, I know I’m fortunately past my initial learning stages as a teenager. I have a lot of work ahead, but at least I don’t have to (completely) start from scratch.\nI’m of course constrained by the skills I’ve developed up until now, but still, I can have a blast. That’s why in this article, I’ll share with you what I believe is a healthy mindset when embarking on the  journey of\nlanguage learning\nlearning anything.\nCheers to Small Wins\nProgress at the beginning is relatively fast.\nBeing able to appreciate your newly developed abilities is essential. These are your small achievements, and they add up quicker than you think. So, even though the language learning journey might feel neverending (because indeed it is), developing the ability to acknowledge your achievements will get you far.\nSet Realistic Goals\nThis takes us to this second suggestion. Break down your\nlanguage\nlearning journey into manageable goals.\nNow, in terms of goals, focus on practical skills, and not just on the theoretical side of things. It’s very easy to fall in the trap of thinking you need knowledge in order to develop a set of skills, but oftentimes that assumption does not hold true.\nUse a language notebook\nMost students have a notebook or a collection of sheets of paper, at least. But few really take it for what is worth. Don’t underestimate the power of a language notebook. Whether it’s new words, class insights, or catchy phrases, it’s your personal language repository. Each scribble is a step towards proficiency, making your notebook not just a record but a living map of your linguistic journey.\nLeverage your learning with technology\nMake use of language-learning apps, online resources, and digital flashcards to supplement your learning. Technology can add an interactive and dynamic dimension to your study routine.\nEmbrace Natural Input\nI’ve talked many times before about the importance of\nnatural input\n. Don’t underestimate the power of exposing yourself to real Spanish.\nTurn INPUT into OUTPUT\nThis one is arguably the tip that will push you towards your ultimate goal of actually speaking Spanish. Unless you find outlets for however little you can say at every stage of the learning process, you’ll give up before seeing the results.\nIf you watch a movie, make a short summary of the movie plot inyour own words. If you listen to a podcast or read an article, do the same. Always use your target language, even if you need to look words up in the dictionary.\nLearn to learn from mistakes\nEmbrace errors as opportunities to learn. Mistakes are stepping stones to improvement. Analyze them, understand the corrections, and move forward.\nBuild up your confidence\nAll the effort you’re making in order to tame the language must help you feel confident and on path. Don’t let negative thoughts to creep in.\nSurviving the Language Plateau\nNow, after the initial\nlanguage\nfiesta, even if you follow this advice, you’ll hit what is commonly referred to as the\nlanguage\nplateau. It’s that moment when you realize the progress isn’t as rapid as in the beginning. Don’t panic, it’s the calm after the\nlinguistic\nstorm. It’s a moment to gather your thoughts.\nAs you navigate through the\nlanguage\nplateau, it’s essential to take a closer look at your journey. Recognize where you stumble, whether it’s grappling with grammar rules, expanding your vocabulary, or refining pronunciation. Being aware of these challenges is a roadmap to improvement. This will allow you to tailor your learning experience, focusing on areas that need a bit more attention.\nIt’s the journey, not just the destination\nAdd lastly, always remember, becoming\nfluent\nproficient is a marathon, not a sprint. It’s not about how quickly you can reach the finish line; it’s about enjoying the ride.\nTake it easy, enjoy it.\nNext Post »\nEspañol Neutro\nPrevious Post »\nAguantar los trapos | To stand one’s ground\nYou might also want to read these articles:\nThe Paradox of Choice\nToday, I want to introduce the concept of paradox of choice, and show you how it’s detrimental to your progress.\nArgentinian Spanish Input (part 1)\nIn this post, I included podcasts you can try to leverage your learning with natural input.\nEl que te jedi\nLearn a fun way of saying you-know-who in Rioplatense Spanish.\nInfumable\nHave you heard Argentinians using this word before?

The only exception to this pattern is\nSER\n, which turns to\nSOS\ninstead of\nERES\nWhen you come to Argentina, everyone will ask you ‘\n¿De dónde sos?\n‘ and not ‘\n¿De dónde eres?\n‘\nPAGAR\nHACER\nABRIR\nTÚ\npaga\ncome\nabre\nVOS\npag\ná\ncom\né\nabr\ní\nIMPERATIVO AFIRMATIVO\nListen again, this time to how the imperatives sound:\nThe only verb that does not follow these patterns is\nIR\n, which becomes\nANDÁ\ninstead of\nVÉ\n2# PRONOUNS\nVOS is a different PERSONAL PRONOUN, but TÚ pronouns are used with VOS everywhere else.\nFor example,\nWhen you want to ask the same question to your interlocutor, instead of asking “¿Y tú?”, you would ask “¿Y vos?”.\nIn all other cases, it will be derivative from TÚ: ¿Cuál es TU nombre?’ or ‘\n¿Qué tal TU viaje?\n‘\nFrequently asked questions\nLet me try to answer some of que most frequent questions regarding the use of VOS in Argentina.\nAre\nVOS forms used throughout the country?\nYes, in Argentina everyone uses VOS forms. In some regions, people might use the VOS pronoun and TÚ forms, though.\nWhich tenses are modified with the 2nd person VOS?\nMost tenses keep the TÚ forms, except for the present indicative and the affirmative imperative. You can see exactly how\nhere\n.\nIs the 2nd person possessive adjective [tu] or other pronouns affected by ‘voseo’\n?\nNo, like we said above, tu (withouth the accent mark but pronounced all the same) remains the possessive adjective. The only difference is in the use of VOS is combined with the prepositions ‘con’ and ‘para’. In TÚ forms they become\ncontigo\n| para tí, while in VOS forms it’s con vos |\npara vos\n.\nIs TÚ the formal alternative to VOS in Argentinian Spanish?\nNo, the alternative is USTED, as in the other varieties of Spanish. It is used in situations where the other person is unknown and older, or of a higher rank in the company structure.\nDo all Argentines use vos forms in all circumstances?\nAlmost always. VOS has advanced in many areas, both written and oral. It is now common for voseo to prevail in many situations that used to correspond to the use of USTED: movies, radio, television, advertisements, literature, interviews, government communication with citizens. However, as I mentioned above, USTED is still the form used for a respectful treatment: with older people and in certain work situations of great formality.\nWhat’s the origin of VOS forms?\nThere are different opinions on the matter that involve Brazilian influences and Roman Emperors, but the one I find more solid is that over the centuries, the Spanish that arrived to present day Argentina in the 16th century changed gradually. The Viceroyalty of Río de la Plata was formed in 1776 and these territories became isolated from the centers of power. What was by those standards a respectful way of addressing someone of a higher status became the opposite. Both ‘tú’ and ‘vuestra merced’ were used in situations of closeness or trust, while ‘vos’ was used to show the other person was in a position of authority.\nPlease write a comment if you have any other questions related to the use of VOS. I’ll be happy to answer them.\nAnd of course if you want to learn Argentinian Spanish with me, just head to the\nLESSONS MENU\n.\nThanks, and happy Spanish learning,\nNext Post »\nUses of -ITO in Argentine Spanish\nPrevious Post »\nMATE = Argentina\nYou might also want to read these articles:\nThe Paradox of Choice\nToday, I want to introduce the concept of paradox of choice, and show you how it’s detrimental to your progress.\nArgentinian Spanish Input (part 1)\nIn this post, I included podcasts you can try to leverage your learning with natural input.\nEl que te jedi\nLearn a fun way of saying you-know-who in Rioplatense Spanish.\nInfumable\nHave you heard Argentinians using this word before?

Some of them are adaptations from sayings that originated in other languages, and some keep the metaphor but change the elements.\nToday, we’ll be looking at some of the most frequent Argentinian sayings. Note that it’s quite inaccurate to call these Argentinian sayings, but rather they should be considered common to most Spanish speaking countries.\nHowever from all the sayings you can find online, these are guaranteed to be of common use in Argentina.\nOne more thing. In some cases it’s very common to only say the first part of the phrase, and that’s enough for the other person to understand what you mean. I’ll highlight the part it’s often heard in bold.\nThe list is in alphabetical order:\nA caballo regalado\nno se le miran los dientes\n“Don’t look a gift horse in the mouth.” It means that when you receive something as a gift, you shouldn’t be critical or overly selective about it.\nAl  mal tiempo\n, buena cara\n“Keep a stiff upper lip.” This saying advises maintaining a positive attitude and demeanor even in difficult or challenging situations.\nA falta de pan\n, buenas son las tortas\n“In the absence of bread, cakes are good.” It suggests that when facing scarcity or limitations, it’s important to make do with what is available, even if it’s not the ideal solution.\nA papá/mamá mono con bananas verdes, no\n“Don’t mess with mommy or daddy monkey with green bananas.” Don’t try to outsmart someone with more experience.\nAl que madruga\n, Dios lo ayuda\n“God helps those who wake up early.” It emphasizes the idea that being proactive and starting the day early can lead to success.\nAl que quiere celeste\n, que le cueste\n“If you want heaven’s blue, you’ll have to pay the price.” It conveys the idea that achieving something desirable usually requires effort or sacrifice.\nA río revuelto, ganancia de pescadores\n“In troubled waters, fishermen profit.” It suggests that during chaotic or unstable times, some individuals may benefit or find opportunities for gain.\nA seguro\nse lo llevaron preso\n“Seguro [as if it was a person’s name, but referring to certainty] was taken to jail.” It’s used when someone seems overly confident about something, implying that certainty often leads to disappointment.\nAunque la mona se vista de seda\n, mona queda\nIt’s similar to the English saying “You can’t make a silk purse out of a sow’s ear.” It emphasizes that true nature or character cannot be hidden or changed by outward appearances.\nCría cuervos\ny te arrancarán los ojos\n“Raise crows and they will pluck out your eyes.” It implies that nurturing or supporting those who are ungrateful or malicious can lead to betrayal or harm.\nCuando el gato no está\n, los ratones se divierten\nIn English we say “When the cat’s away, the mice will play.” It means that in the absence of authority or supervision, people are more likely to misbehave or take liberties.\nDe tal palo\n, tal astilla\nThe English equivalent for this one is “Like father, like son.” It suggests that children often resemble their parents in behavior or character traits.\nEl que mucho abarca\n, poco aprieta\n“Jack of all trades, master of none.” It emphasizes the importance of focusing one’s efforts and skills on a specific area to achieve mastery.\nEn casa de herrero\ncuchillo de palo\n“In the blacksmith’s house, a wooden knife.” it suggests that sometimes the tools or skills needed for a task might be missing, even in a place where they should be abundant.\nEl que mal anda\n, mal acaba\nThe English saying is “Those who walk the wrong path, end up in a bad place.” The idea behind this one is pretty obvious. The idea that one’s actions and choices have consequences, and negative behavior typically leads to negative outcomes.\nEl que sabe, sabe\n“Who knows, knows.” Quite self explanatory. It’s used to highlight the fact if someone knows about a topic, it will show.\nEl diablo sabe por diablo, pero más sabe por viejo\n“The devil knows because he’s the devil, but he knows more because he’s old.” It suggests that experience often teaches more than innate knowledge or cunning.\nEl ojo del amo\n, engorda al ganado\n“The eye of the master fattens the cattle.” It suggests that supervision or oversight from a knowledgeable authority figure can lead to better results or productivity.\nEl que avisa\n, no traiciona\n“The one who warns, doesn’t betray.” It’s used when someone informs others in advance of what they plan to do under a certain event, that should not be considered treachery.\nEl que no llora, no mama\n“He who doesn’t cry, doesn’t get milk.” It implies that speaking up or expressing one’s needs is necessary to get what you want.\nEn el país de los ciegos\n, el tuerto es rey\n“In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king.” It conveys the idea that in a situation where others lack competence or awareness, even a person with limited abilities can achieve superiority or dominance.\nHecha la ley\n, hecha la trampa\n“Once the law is made, the trick is made.” It implies that rules or regulations can be circumvented or exploited, emphasizing the human tendency to find workarounds.\nHierba mala nunca muere\n“Weeds never die.” It suggests that negative or undesirable things often persist or endure despite efforts to eradicate them.\nLas cuentas claras\nconservan amistades\n“Clear accounts maintain friendships.” It suggests that transparency and honesty in financial matters are essential for preserving good relationships and avoiding misunderstandings.\nLo barato sale caro\n“The cheap turns out expensive.” It suggests that opting for the cheapest option may ultimately cost more in terms of quality, durability, or additional expenses.\nLos de afuera son de palo\n“Outsiders are made of wood.” It implies that those who are not directly involved in a situation may not fully understand it or have valid opinions about it.\nLo que abunda no daña\n“What abounds doesn’t harm.” It implies that having an excess of something is not harmful and may even be beneficial.\nLos trapos sucios se lavan en casa\n“Dirty laundry is washed at home.” It emphasizes the importance of keeping family or personal matters private and resolving conflicts within the confines of one’s home or group.\nMal de muchos\n, consuelo de tontos\nI guess the equivalent in English is “Misery loves company.” It suggests that finding comfort in the fact that others are also experiencing difficulties is not wise, as it doesn’t alleviate one’s own problems.\nMás vale prevenir\nque curar\n“It is better to prevent than to cure.” It suggests that it’s wiser to invest effort in preventing difficulties from arising rather than having to address them after they occur.\nMás vale tarde que nunca\n“Better late than never.” It suggests that it’s better to complete a task or achieve a goal belatedly than to not do so at all.\nMejor malo conocido\nque bueno por conocer.\n“Better the devil you know than the devil you don’t.” It suggests that it’s safer to deal with a familiar problem or person than to risk encountering an unknown one.\nNo creo en brujas, pero que las hay…las hay\n“I don’t believe in witches, but that they exist…they do.” It acknowledges the existence of strange or inexplicable phenomena despite personal skepticism.\nNo gastes pólvora en chimangos.\n“Don’t waste gunpowder on chimangos.” Chimangos are birds of prey known for stealing food from other birds. It advises against expending effort or resources on insignificant or unworthy individuals or situations.\nNo hay dos sin tres\n“There is no two without three.” It implies that when something happens twice, a third occurrence is likely to follow, often used to indicate a pattern or expectation.\nNo hay mal que por bien no venga\n“There is no bad from which good does not come.” It suggests that even negative experiences or setbacks may lead to positive outcomes or opportunities for growth.\nNo hay peor ciego que el que no quiere ver\n“There is no worse blind person than the one who refuses to see.” It emphasizes the idea that ignorance or denial of the truth can be more detrimental than physical blindness, highlighting the importance of being open to reality.\nNo por mucho madrugar\namanece más temprano\n“Waking up early won’t make the dawn come sooner.” It’s the opposite of the previous one above. It suggests that rushing or overexerting oneself won’t necessarily accelerate the desired outcome.\nOjos que no ven\n, corazón que no siente\n“Eyes that don’t see, heart that doesn’t feel.” It suggests that if you are unaware of something, it won’t affect you emotionally.\nPan para hoy\n, hambre para mañana\nIt implies that satisfying immediate needs without considering the future consequences may lead to further difficulties later on.\nPerro que ladra, no muerde\n“A barking dog seldom bites.” It implies that those who make the most noise are not always the most dangerous or threatening.\nPueblo chico, infierno grande\n“Small town, big hell.” It conveys the idea that living in a small community can lead to heightened drama or intense interpersonal conflicts due to everyone knowing each other’s business.\nSoldado que huye\n, sirve para otra guerra\n“A soldier who flees serves for another war.” It implies that someone who retreats or runs away from a challenge may have the opportunity to face a different, perhaps more suitable, situation in the future.\nUna golondrina no hace verano\n“One swallow does not make a summer.” It emphasizes the need to consider multiple factors or events before drawing conclusions or making judgments.\nHopefully this list has helped you level up your command of Spanish sayings,\nNext Post »\nProcess Feedback from Lessons Effectively\nPrevious Post »\nNi la más p*ta idea\nYou might also want to read these articles:\nThe Paradox of Choice\nToday, I want to introduce the concept of paradox of choice, and show you how it’s detrimental to your progress.\nArgentinian Spanish Input (part 1)\nIn this post, I included podcasts you can try to leverage your learning with natural input.\nEl que te jedi\nLearn a fun way of saying you-know-who in Rioplatense Spanish.\nInfumable\nHave you heard Argentinians using this word before?

In case you aren’t, today’s word might be exactly what you need to express it.\nFiaca is a word that belongs to a group of words that are unique to RPS: those we incorporated from\nItalian immigrants\n.\nAnd over the years we’ve made sure the word stays around. Fiaca is the word you’d use when you’re feeling sluggish.\n“\nTengo\nfiaca.”\nSometimes we use the indefinite article una before the word. You can’t have two fiacas, but in Spanish it’s quite common to express a feeling like this with un/una.\n“\nTengo\nuna fiaca hoy…”\n(The same as “tengo un sueño…” or “tengo un hambre…”)\nVery similarly, we sometimes prefer to say:\n“Hoy\nestoy con\nuna fiaca terrible.”\nAnd then there’s one other possibility which sounds kind of cute. When you have a free-ish day ahead you, you can cammit yourself to doing nothing like this:\n“Hoy voy a\nhacer\nfiaca todo el día.”\nWhatever the case, I’m sure FIACA can become part of your vocabulary.\nHere’s a useful PDF you can grab before you leave:\nSign up to the newsletter and download your FREE Argentinian Spanish Phrasebook!\nCLICK HERE\nThanks for stopping by,\nNext Post »\nI crushed it | La rompí\nPrevious Post »\nProcess Feedback from Lessons Effectively\nYou might also want to read these articles:\nThe Paradox of Choice\nToday, I want to introduce the concept of paradox of choice, and show you how it’s detrimental to your progress.\nArgentinian Spanish Input (part 1)\nIn this post, I included podcasts you can try to leverage your learning with natural input.\nEl que te jedi\nLearn a fun way of saying you-know-who in Rioplatense Spanish.\nInfumable\nHave you heard Argentinians using this word before?

For the last 15 years it’s been associated with Messi.\n¿\nViste el partido? ¡Messi la rompió, boludo!\nBut you can use it in any of the previous examples and you’ll sound great.\nOne use I like is when someone did a great job.

{"url": "https://ventureoutspanish.com/argentinian-accent/", "title": "Master the Argentinian accent | Venture Out Spanish", "text": "Master the Argentinian accent\nPost author:\nMatías\nPost published:\nDecember 10, 2022\nReading time:\n22 mins read\nThank you for sharing this post!\nShare this content\nOpens in a new window\nOpens in a new window\nOpens in a new window\nOpens in a new window\nOpens in a new window\nOpens in a new window\nCaminito, La Boca | Ciudad de Buenos Aires\nGet yourself a mate (this one 🧉), and come back to this article. This is an insider’s guide to the elements of the Argentinian accent.\nThe more I compare Argentine accent with other Spanish speaking countries (except to Uruguay’s that is), the more I become aware that there’s something to it. For some reason, it’s likable.\nThe prototypical Argentine personality might contribute to this, but the pronunciation and intonation definitely have more to do with it.\nWhatever your reasons for digging deep into our accent are, you have to know that you’ll have to devote time to identify the features and apply the strategies I’m about to share with you.\nI recorded audio files to give you a reference of all aspects I mention during the post. Hope it helps!\nTL;DR:\nHow to speak AR Spanish\nWhy bother?\nDepending on what brought you here, you might be asking yourself the question. In my case, I never made a decision regarding which English accent I wanted to master. I just thought that my goal was to speak English well all the way. Today, I’m a hybrid at best.\nIt’s perfectly fine if you don’t mind which Spanish you speak. The main goal is to speak and be understood without interference. Accent usually comes at a later stage and it’s a deliberate choice.\nAnd, hey, don’t forget it’s a remarkable achievement to finally master it.\nThere are language learners who set off with a preference or get to spend time in one particular Spanish speaking country. If this is your case, be it that you a) like the Argentinian accent or b) you are living in Argentina, surrounding yourself with the sounds of this particular variety of Spanish is a must. All of your interactions will turn into accent training sessions.\nThe importance of patterns\nLanguage, in writing, has patterns. Which? Those that syntax demands. Spoken language does have patterns, too. Which? Those of speech.\nSee, when I read something written in Spanish chances are I might come across with a word that hints the nationality of the writer, but it’s not as obvious as if I listen to someone speaking. It will take me a few seconds in that case.\nWhy is that? How’s that possible?\nBecause speech expresses much more than written language!\nSpecifically, there are 4 elements we need to address. The four ingredients of what we call an accent are:\nPronunciation\nWord stress\nIntonation\nFlow\nVeamos.\nPronunciation\nThis is the most elementary building block. You need to make sure you know the sounds of Spanish as well as those characteristic of Argentine Spanish.\nLet’s review.\nYour vowels should be short and crisp, especially Os and Es\nMuy bueno\nBastante caro\nMuy tarde\nLuz verde\nQuiero eso\nYour Rs should be rolling Rs\nRA | RE | RI | RO | RU\n¡Rápido, ruso! ¡Regresa al río!\nRompe ramas y rema contra la corriente.\nEn ruinas, roto, arruinado.\nRepetí: reíte y relajá.\nYour Bs and Vs should sound the same (like a /b/ in English)\nVos\nBuenas\nVerdad\nVino\nBaño\nAvión\nBuenos Aires\n¡Vamos!\nYour Ys and LLs should sound like /sh/\nMe llamó Guille.\nCallate la boca.\nLlename de besos.\nEl cumpleaños de Yael es en mayo\nYo de eso ya no sé.\nLlevame las llaves a la clase de yoga.\nYour Zs, Cs and Ss should all sound like /s/ . There is no lisp in the Argentine accent.\nZapatilla\nCecilia\nAstros\nCasamiento\nCazador\nThe letter H is always silent\nAhora\nHoy\nHay\nHabía\nCohete\nAlso keep in mind that preconsonantic S before c, g, l, m, p and v is similar to an H in english:\ne\nsc\nuchá\n/ehcuchá/\nbú\nsq\nueda\n/búhqueda/\nco\nsq\nuillas\n/cohquillas/\nMo\nsc\nú\n/Mohcú/\nra\nsg\nuñar\n/rahguñar/\ni\nsl\na\n/ihla/\nmu\nsl\no\n/muhlo/\ne\nsm\nalte /ehmalte/\ne\nsm\nero\n/ehmero/\nho\nsp\nital\n/ohpital/\ne\nsp\nañol\n/ehpañol/\nde\nsp\nierto\n/dehpierto/\nO\nsv\naldo\n/Ohvaldo/\nIf you listen carefully, you will notice that we do the same when the s is the last letter of a word and the following word starts with c or l:\nlos lunes\n/loh lunes/\nlas cosas\n/lahcosas/\nmis creencias\n/mihcreencias/\nel más grande\n/elmahgrande/\ntus labios\n/tuhlabios/\nlas moscas\n/lahmohcas/\nes lo mismo\n/ehlomihmo/\nes verdad\n/ehverdad/\nand final Ds in the suffix -idad | -edad are dropped:\nverdad /verdá/\nclaridad /claridá/\nbarbaridad /barbaridá/\nsolidaridad /solidaridá/\nTroubleshoot any issues on this area before moving further. And remember that retraining your mouth takes time and practice.\nWord stress\nYou can’t just hope for the best when it comes to word stress. You know that sometimes Spanish, as opposed to English, signals stressed syllables with a tilde. You can’t miss those.\nBut there is more to word stress than that rule.\nIt gets more tricky. If a word has no tilde and ends in a vowel, n or s, then the second to last vowel is stressed. If the words end in any other consonant, the last syllable is stressed.\nSpanish tends to stress the second to last syllable in a word ending in n, s or a vowel. We use tildes to show that the word is an exception to the rule.\nAlso, since we are discussing the AR Spanish accent, don’t lose sight of the fact that Argentinian Spanish reflects the impact of\nVOS forms\nin verb stress in the present and imperative affirmative forms.\nI’m not going to repeat myself here, but you can find examples in the article linked just above.\nPRESENTE INDICATIVO\n¿Cómo te llamás?\n¿A qué te dedicás?\n¿Comés carne?\n¿Vivís solo/a?\nIMPERATIVO AFIRMATIVO\n¡Mirá vos!\nEscuchá este tema.\nPreguntá en los foros.\nProbá la fainá.\nIntonation\nThis is the musical side of languages. This is why we can say, for example, that Brazilian Portuguese sounds livey or German intimidating.\nOur tone of voice conveys a lot of meaning. You might do it instinctively in your native language, but then all of a sudden forget to do it when you speak Spanish.\nKeep an eye on this. If you are surprised, convey surprise in your intonation. The same if you are angry, happy, curious or uncertain.\nIn Spanish, declarative intonation is typically descending while interrogative intonation, on the other hand, is typically ascending.\nNecesitás ayuda. ↓\n¿Necesitás ayuda? ↑\nIn longer sentences we usually raise the pitch of our voice to highlight specific words to prevent the ship (the sentence) from sinking. Look at this example:\nLo primero que hago ↓| cuando me levanto ↓ a la mañana ↑, | es prepararme un mate ↓\nA side note: if you compare spoken AR Spanish and Italian, it is easy to notice the similarities between the two. Italian has  exerted a decisive influence on AR Spanish and the intonation of Italian was assimilated into our Spanish in ways we (natives) are not usually aware of.\nFlow\nOften, non-native speakers produce the sounds of their target language, but integrating them as if they were speaking in their own language.\nThat is a no-no at this stage.\nFlow refers to the rhythm of the spoken language. Listening and imitating the rhythm of native speakers is key to mastering flow.\nFlow has to do especially with learning to link sounds in a phrase or sentence and with being in the pocket, as we say in music to keeping time.\nIn Spanish, rhythm requires that each syllable and, above all, each word have approximately the same duration.\nIn order to do that, function words (such as articles, possessives or prepositions) are packed together with content words (nouns, adjectives, verbs and adverbs).\nel aceite de oliva – elaceite deoliva\nla puerta de mi casa – lapuerta demicasa\nun oso rojo – unoso rojo\ntres de mis amigos – tres demisamigos\nel otro día – elotrodía\nIf a vowel is the last letter in a word and first letter in the other, it might also sound as if the word is only one.\nIn some cases, we might make one vowel sound out of two repeated vowels:\nHola a todos /Holatodos/\nUna remera azul /Unaremerazul/\nEse estudiante /Esestudiante/\nLa anterior /Lanterior/\nAs they are so relevant to the flow of our speech, let’s tackle groups of meaning. This is our sample sentence:\n“Mi hermano vive en Dinamarca.”\nGroups of meaning are extremely important in all languages. When you have groups of meaning you have bigger bricks than the isolated words, and if you do it well, you’ll sound much more natural. In this example the blocks are:\nWho – mi hermano\nWhat (ACTION) – vive\nWhere – en Dinamarca\nIf you heard me saying the sentence and weren’t reading it, you would not be able to tell there are 5 words in this sentence. If I asked you, you’d probably say three.\n“Miher\nma\nno\n|\nvi\nve\n|\nendina\nmar\nca.”\nMaybe, even 2:\n“Miher\nma\nno | vivendina\nmar\nca.”\nEach chunk carries stress in one syllable. Can you hear it?\nAnd one last thing: Argentine Spanish is perceived as fast spoken, but this should not be your ultimate goal. Slowing down and focusing on all that has been said is much more recommended than chasing light-speed articulation.\nMy favourite examples\nA great example of Argentinian accent craftmanship is\nDustin Luke\n. In case you don’t kow him, he is an American guy from Atlanta who fell in love (or did he get obsessed?) with Porteño Spanish and went on to acquire a native Argentinian accent.\nHow did he do it?\nIn order to achieve such an impressive feat, he lived in Argentina for several years, surrounded himself with anything but the local dialect, dated an Argentine girl and eventually accomplished his goal. He talks about this in many of his videos, and I like to listen to him describe his journey. Make sure you check him out.\nUPDATE: I recently discovered\nLadistino\n, a French guy who also fell in love with Argentina and absolutely nailed the accent. Great IG channel to check out.\nAnd\nTHIS\namazing YT series called “¿Por qué acá?” in which you will be able to listen to interviews to several expats who decided to settle down in Argentina. Most of them have become proficient Argentinian Spanish speakers. Listening to foreign people speaking AR Spanish gives me immense joy.\nFinal words\nOf course, reading is one thing, and speaking is another, but they interact with each other. The best is to find a YouTube video with an accurate transcription. I’ll soon be posting some ways in which you can take your Argentinian accent to the next level.\nIf you’ve come until the end of this post, congratulations then.

Today I want to share with you a more singular compilation. This time, it’s of Argentinian slang phrases, idioms and expressions that you’ll certainly spot frequently among the speech of Argentinian people.\nYou don’t know what LUNFARDO is? Start\nHERE\nand then come back.\nI once heard that Argentina is like a lab for Spanish, a country where we are always experimenting with language. We are inventive, to say the least. I love to perk my ears and hunt down Argentinian phrases whenever I hear them.\nBe careful, though. Some of these Argentinian Spanish slang expressions can be gross. It’s better to play safe and stay away from those marked with an * altogether, or at least until you feel you know what contexts are appropriate to use them. You could have fun at Google translate with the literal translations of those that are not ‘transparent’ enough.\nThe importance of slang expressions in every day conversation\nIf you’re planning on traveling to Argentina or regularly hang out with Argentinians, you should definitely learn some of our slang phrases. We Argentinians are known for using a lot of slang in our everyday conversations, and it’s a big part of our culture.\nBy understanding some of these phrases, you’ll be able to engage in conversations more easily and make connections with locals. Plus, it’s just fun to use some of the more colorful expressions we have.\nOkay, just one last thing, before we move on.\nExpressions, phrases and idioms\nBefore you dive into the list below, perhaps it’s relevant to understand the basic difference between expressions, phrases and idioms.\nIt’s easy to think of these terms as interchangeable. But, strictly speaking, they aren’t.\nPHRASE\n: A phrase is just a group of words that go together to convey a certain meaning. It can be a subject or predicate or just a bunch of words that modify other parts of a sentence. Phrases can include a subject and a verb, but they don’t always form a complete sentence on their own.\nEXPRESSION\n: An expression, on the other hand, is a group of words that are commonly used together and have a figurative meaning that is different from the literal meaning of the words. Expressions can be made up of one or more words and often have a cultural or historical context.\nIDIOM\n: Idioms are expressions that have a meaning that is not immediately obvious from the words used. They often have a figurative meaning that cannot be inferred from the literal meaning of the words. Idioms are unique to a language or culture and can be difficult to understand for non-native speakers.\nEven when you can learn these phrases, expressions and idioms without knowing what they are exactly, you could ask yourself ‘What’s this?’\nIt’s difficult to find the exact match for some, but I tried to get as close to the idea as I could. If you know a better English translation, please let me know! For some of the phrases here, I’ve already created independent posts that you can read to find examples of how we use them.

What I read most commonly goes along the lines of:\n“Do not think in your native language.”\nIt’s one of those dogmas that seems to have been adopted by every language opinionologist out there.\nHowever, I feel it’s not that simple.\nI mean, I know why it’s being said, but that cuts off the good things about thinking in your native language.\nWhat good things?\nWell, I always point to the fact that when you learn a foreign language, what you are actually doing is creating a new version of yourself as a speaker of such language.\nWhy would you start all over again when there’s a lot you can import from that default configuration in your brain?\nLet’s see:\n#1 Faster progress\nFirstly, leveraging your native language can speed up the learning process. By drawing parallels between your L1 and the target language, you can grasp new concepts more quickly. For instance, understanding grammatical structures or vocabulary similarities can provide a reference point.\nIn many cases, the defensive reaction is ‘I don’t understand how my L1 works’. But that’s a lazy answer. If you want to stand up for the challenge, you need to activate your ability to compare and contrast both languages.\nThis doesn’t mean you need to become a grammar expert overnight; rather, it means being curious and attentive to patterns and differences..\n#2 Deeper comprehension\nSecondly, using your native language can enhance comprehension. When encountering complex ideas or abstract concepts in the target language, translating them into your L1 can clarify their meanings. This is particularly useful in advanced language learning, where nuanced understanding is crucial.\n#3 A more authentic you\nThirdly, retaining a connection to your L1 can make learning less artificial, less robotic. Like I said at the beginning, if you are creating a new version of yourself in the target language, why would you want to sound like a cyborg, mechanically performing without genuine expression? Language is not just a set of rules and vocabulary; it’s a means of expressing your personality, emotions, and thoughts.\nIf you allow yourself to think in your native language, you can alleviate some of that pressure. This approach can boost your confidence and encourage a more natural use of the target language.\nThis takes us to the pitfalls we want to avoid:\nAvoiding the Pitfalls: The Dangers of Literal Translation\nIt’s important to note, however, that translating word by word from your native language to the target language can be problematic. Literal translations often lead to awkward or incorrect sentences, as languages rarely align perfectly in structure and idiom.\nFor example, the English phrase “It’s raining cats and dogs” translates awkwardly if taken literally into another language. Each language has its unique expressions and cultural context, so understanding these nuances is key.\nYour own Cheatsheet\nInstead of word-for-word translation, I recommend creating mental cheat sheets. This involves noting down phrases or expressions you commonly use in your L1 and finding their natural equivalents in the target language. Over time, this practice helps you think in the target language while still leveraging the familiar framework of your native tongue.\nFor example, if you frequently use the phrase “I need to catch up on work” in English, find its natural equivalent in Spanish. Rather than translating each word, learn the expression as a whole: “Necesito ponerme al día con las cosas del laburo.”\nIn conclusion, don’t fall in the trap of blacks or whites. The advice to avoid thinking in your native language has merit, but it’s not an absolute rule.\nWould love to hear your thoughts on this!\nAnd, by the way, thanks for taking the time to read the whole thing. I would like to offer you Spreadsheet I use with my students where I tried to show it works:\nClick here to make a copy\nHappy Spanish learning,\nNext Post »\nTal cual\nPrevious Post »\nGostear y Fantasmear\nYou might also want to read these articles:\nThe Paradox of Choice\nToday, I want to introduce the concept of paradox of choice, and show you how it’s detrimental to your progress.\nArgentinian Spanish Input (part 1)\nIn this post, I included podcasts you can try to leverage your learning with natural input.\nEl que te jedi\nLearn a fun way of saying you-know-who in Rioplatense Spanish.\nInfumable\nHave you heard Argentinians using this word before?

In fancy terms, it’s a vernacular form of Spanish:\na vernacular language, expression, or mode of expression: an expression or mode of expression that occurs in ordinary speech rather than formal writing.\nIt’s the perfect example of the mutant talent of Spanish under the influence of Italian. Perhaps only surpassed by\nthe grammatical changes produced by VOS\nand YEISMO, it’s what gives Argentinian Spanish its unique identity.\nIt’s very difficult to say what is ‘Lunfardo’ and what is an ‘Argentinianism’ (the former being a part of the latter), and there are serious studies on the matter carried out by linguists, trying to settle the controversy. One thing is certain: it is a mark of Argentine identity.\nLunfardo shows that a language is what people do to it.\nWhat is Lunfardo?\nLunfardo is a set of words and expressions which are used in every day conversation in Argentina, but whose meaning is highly idiomatic and cryptic for ‘outsiders’. Its origins date back to the late 1870s.\nOnce upon a time in Buenos Aires…\nLanguages contain a political message. We speak Spanish because that was the language of the Spanish conquistadors.\nFor a long time, Spain held the reigns of the use of Spanish, pretending to set the standards. It was wishful thinking, aided by the opinion of some influential characters of those times who pledge loyalty to the purity of Spanish. Fortunately, time has shown that neither English, Portuguese or Spanish have remained the same in America.\nThe history of the origins of our Argentine Slang is really powerful as it shows that each community shapes the language according to their needs and their reality. In the late 19th century,  European immigrants, mostly Spanish and Italians, arrived in great numbers to Argentina, bringing their language and idiomatic expressions along with them.\nMany of them continued their journey into the interior of Argentina, but many stayed in Buenos Aires.\nTo give an idea of the demographics, at the beginning of the 20th century half of the males between the ages of 15 and 50 living in Buenos Aires had been born in Italy. The neighborhood of La Boca, the area beside the port, was known as “the little Genoa” at that time.\nSeveral families would live together in shared buildings called conventillos. These were the homes of the wealthy classes readapted to the new purposes. Each of them had an average of sixty tenants.\nThey, too, tried to adapt to their new realities.\nCocoliche was one by product of this situation. So, let’s stop at cocoliche for a moment.\nCocoliche\nCocoliche was the first outcome of the encounter of Italian and Spanish. It was no more and no less than the Spanish spoken by Italians while they were trying to assimilate into the new society into which they had become part of.\nYou can see\nHERE\nhow many words from Italian are part of our Rioplatense dialect.\nContributors to Lunfardo\nHowever, it was not just Italian that contributed to Lunfardo. So did the rural language of gauchos, caló (spoken by Romany people in Spain and Portugal), French and Portuguese, as well as aboriginal languages such as Quechua and African languages.\nStill, the origin of the word Lunfardo does seem to be linked to the Italian word ‘lumbardo’, thief. And, in its origins it seemed to be indeed the jargon of crime.\nJournalists as well as criminologists were particularly interested in it, and the first studies of the subject came from those fields.\nFor a long time, it was thought that only criminals used Lunfardo, or at least it was considered el lenguaje del bajo fondo, the language of the underground side of the city.\nHowever, it’s important to note that the semantic fields of Lunfardo extend beyond those of the crime and felony.\nTango and Lunfardo\nTango music made it clear that was not precisely the case. Tango played a major role in the dissemination of many words of popular origin. Its lyrics are full of Lunfardo.\nThis breakthrough of Lunfardo was not without problems. For example, during the 1930s, many lyrics of popular tango songs had to be rewritten to overcome the censorship of that time, which considered it was against morality and decency.\nTOP Lunfardo words\nOkay, you know enough about the history of Lunfardo and you are now ready to actually learn some of the most iconic Argentine slang words.\nBONDI | BUS\nFIACA | SLOTHFULNESS\nLABURO | WORK\nLABURAR | TO WORK\nCHAMUYERO | LIAR\nCANCHERO | TOO FULL OF HIMSELF\nGUITA | MONEY\nMINA | WOMAN\nTIPO | MAN\nPIBE | GUY\nPIBA | GIRL\nQUILOMBO | MESS\nPIOLA | CLEVER\nTRUCHO | FAKE\nMORFAR | TO EAT\nGARPAR | TO PAY\nPUCHO | CIGARETTE\nPILCHA | ROPA\nSign up to the newsletter and download your FREE Argentinian Spanish Phrasebook!\nCLICK HERE\nFor a more extensive list, visit\nTHIS POST\n.\nAnd I also recommend you watching this video:\nWell, I’ll leave it here. I wish you know more now than when you started reading.\nRemember: Lunfardo is not a language and it’s not another name for Argentinian Spanish. It’s not possible to speak in Lunfardo, but rather with Lunfardo.\nHope you find this post on our own Argentine slang helpful!\nIf you want to\nlearn Argentinian Spanish online with a native tutor\n, just let me know, okay?\nHappy Spanish learning,\nNext Post »\nArgentinian Spanish expressions | HACER\nPrevious Post »\nUses of -ÍSIMO in Argentine Spanish\nYou might also want to read these articles:\nThe Paradox of Choice\nToday, I want to introduce the concept of paradox of choice, and show you how it’s detrimental to your progress.\nArgentinian Spanish Input (part 1)\nIn this post, I included podcasts you can try to leverage your learning with natural input.\nEl que te jedi\nLearn a fun way of saying you-know-who in Rioplatense Spanish.\nInfumable\nHave you heard Argentinians using this word before?

(Masa madre in Spanish in case you didn’t know). For some time I had refused to try it as I’d heard quite a few people presenting it like a mysterious and complex process, akin to alchemy.\nBut my love for bread and all flour is unparalleled, so I gave it a try.\nWell, it turns out it’s not that impossible at all. Basically, it’s only flour and water. The magic happens by itself without your intervention.\nYes, once it’s\nalive\nyou need to feed the starter regularly in order not to run out of it and keep your production consistent, but if you looked after a Tamagotchi, nothing you haven’t experienced before.\nLike I assume most bakers see it, my bread literally tells a story. Not just a biological story related to fermentation, but more importantly, the story of my learning. What’s the right ammount of water/salt? What kind of flour works best? How much time should I leave the dough to rise before baking it?\nAnd the best is it’s getting better and better. Not only do I know it’s better, but I can prove it to me and others who have tried it then and now.\nI’ve taken pictures, made notes with the different recipes I experimented with, with the temperature of the oven, cooking time… most possible variables.\nOf course, the kind of better I’m referring to is not the impossible, linear better, but rather consistently better. Some breads are reminders that things can always take a turn for the worse.\nBelieve it or not, I’m telling you this story to connect it with your Spanish learning.\nConcrete evidence of progress not only boosts your confidence but also helps you stay motivated and focused on your goals.\nMati, you got my attention. How can I prove my Spanish progress to myself?\nWell, be creative! Here are some ways you can create tangible proof of your progress as a Spanish learner:\nSET SPECIFIC GOALS\nEstablish clear, achievable goals for your language learning journey. Whether it’s  vocabulary related to specific topics of your interest, a grammar point, developing your writing skills, just name it:\n“\nFor the next week/month/2 hours I’m going to focus on [your choice]\n.”\nRemember to always make your goals specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and time-bound (SMART, as smart guys call them).\nAnd once the term is completed, establish an APPRECIATION DAY. On that day you’ll go back to the beginning and see your journey unfolding right in front of you. I do it with my students and It’s so empowering.\nJOURNAL\nMaintaining a language journal where you track your daily progress can be incredibly beneficial. Write down new vocabulary, grammar rules, and phrases you’ve learned, as well as any conversations or interactions you’ve had in Spanish on any given day.\nIf you do it regularly (on a daily basis), It won’t take long until you have a nice collection of entries to track your progress.\nRECORD YOURSELF\nIt’s unbelievable the sense of otherness you can experience when you record yourself, right? Make several takes of you reading the same/saying the same and pay close attention to what could be improved. Don’t stop until you’re convinced it’s better than the first.\nWATCH A MOVIE\nI’ve discussed the different approaches to movies in\na specific article\n. One strategy that applies to the framework I’m sharing here is rewatching a movie several times at different moments in your journey.\nSay you watch for the first time today. Set a reminder in your calendar to come back to the movie in 60 / 120 / 180 days. Of course, you’ll be more familiar with the movie, and you’ll\nfeel\nthe difference.\nLISTEN TO A PODCAST\nSimilarly, I’ve written\nan article about learning Spanish with podcasts\n. Sometimes we want to listen to an episode 10 times but if we’re missing most of what’s being said it’s possible that the level is too far above for now. Come back later and see how it goes.\nREAD A BOOK\nThe same applies for books. Get a book that makes you wanna read it. If you’re not enjoying it because it becomes tiring, give it some time and go back to it later.\nSEEK FEEDBACK\nPaid Online lessons are not the only way to get feedback. Nowadays we are offered with\nPracticing with native speakers or language exchange partners is a fantastic way to gauge your progress. Pay attention to how easily you can communicate, understand, and express yourself in Spanish during conversations.\nTRAVEL\nThis one is not as easy, but the feeling of accomplishment when you travel and communicate with locals is unmatchable.\nAnyway, by putting these methods into action and actually showing how much you’ve improved in Spanish, you’ll just boost your confidence.\nRemember, staying consistent and attentive are the secret ingredients to mastering a foreign language.\nTo wrap all this up, I want to share a song that will help you remember today’s mantra. Amazing, amazing song. It’s the reason why I chose this title:\nThanks for hitting the bottom of this article,\nHave an awesome day ahead!\nNext Post »\nArgentinian music | A guide\nPrevious Post »\nEstar regalado | Quedar regalado\nYou might also want to read these articles:\nThe Paradox of Choice\nToday, I want to introduce the concept of paradox of choice, and show you how it’s detrimental to your progress.\nArgentinian Spanish Input (part 1)\nIn this post, I included podcasts you can try to leverage your learning with natural input.\nEl que te jedi\nLearn a fun way of saying you-know-who in Rioplatense Spanish.\nInfumable\nHave you heard Argentinians using this word before?

Sit tight and get ready. Watching movies in Spanish will feel different next time you make weekend plans with one. My aim today is to show you how to learn Spanish with movies.\nBut before getting into the details, it’s important that you understand that watching movies in your native language is one thing, and watching movies in your target language is something totally different.\nYou should be warned: forget about being able to watch a movie in Spanish overnight without missing things here and there. It will happen, and that’s okay.\nIf you think you are\ngood at Spanish\nonly when you sit, hit play and 90 minutes later you walk out of the room with another film to add to your list, I’m sorry to tell you that’s not a realistic measure.\nWe don’t want to fantasize that there is a magic shortcut or hack. What we want is to put to use some strategies that will improve your chances and will get better and better with time each time you apply them.\nThe plan is to get actively involved. Ready? Let’s go. I’ll share some ideas and suggestions, you’ll have to try them out and see which, if any, work for you.\nShould I watch movies or series?\nFirst things first. You could apply these same principles to episodes of series, too.\nThe truth is, both can be effective tools for language learning. It all comes down to your personal preference and learning style.\nOn the one hand, movies offer a more focused, self-contained viewing experience. They’re usually shorter than series, so they’re easier to fit into a busy schedule. Plus, they’re generally easier to understand without the need for additional context.\nOn the other hand, series offer the benefit of a longer, more immersive viewing experience. You get to know the characters and storylines over time, which can help you feel more connected to the material.\nIf you’re not sure which one to start with, why not try both and see which one works better for you?\nNow, on with my suggestions to learn Spanish with movies.\nLay the groundwork\nYou need to build rapport with the film, which means:\nGetting the gist. What is the story the film tells? Make a really short summary. Make it fit in 1 sentence.\nGetting to know the characters. Who are the main characters? What can you learn about them at first sight?\nWatch the movie trailer\nThis is so easy to incorporate into your movie watching routine that you will love getting more bang for your buck. Trailers, as confusing as they sometimes are, will give you a sense of what the the film is about. Trailers are not always great at exposing the plot, but you’ll see some relevant scenes and know the main characters.\nWatch in installments\nYou don’t necessarily need to watch the movie end-to-end. You can split the film in 15 minute chunks, so you have more time to ‘digest’ what you saw. It may sound boring or like you are taking too long for just one film, but it will pay off. Once you get to the end, you can watch the full film at once.\nWatch more than once\nRepeated viewings can help you understand the film better and improve your language skills.\nIn this respect, series outperform movies. Watching a 30 minute episode several times is more feasible than a feature film.\nUse visual cues\nFocus on non-verbal language cues. Try to follow the story with the action depicted in the movie, even when you feel lost.\nChange the playback speed\nDid you know that on Netflix you can change the playback speed to 75%?\nDon’t feel guilty about using subtitles\nA lot of language learners feel that using subtitles is like cheating. I disagree.\nThere is no reason to think that you should only relate to movies without subtitles under the assumption that conversations in real life don’t come with subtitles.\nMute the film and read the subtitles\nMaybe this is not the most traditional way of watching, but you can try and see how it goes for you.\nUse Language Reactor\nLanguage Reactor\nis a beautiful thing. It gives you the possibility to watch the movie with dual subs. For know, it only works with Netflix.\nWatch the movie first with English subtitles\nIf you watch the film like this, you will certainly be able to keep up with the story… but you’ll have to watch it again!\nVisit websites to anticipate the main events\nHave you heard of\nIMDB\n? Websites like IMDB can provide helpful information about the film and its characters. You can change the site’s language on the top right corner of your screen and read the site in Spanish.\nWatch movies based on books you’ve read\nThis is quite easy for students of English, but not quite for students of Spanish, I know. Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Hunger Games, Twilight and many more are good examples of the wide variety available for English language learners. But there are still some.\nImitate\nEven if you don’t understand everything that is being said, imitate what you hear. This will help you with intonation patterns. Even if you don’t understand everything that is being said, you can still use movies and series to improve your listening skills by paying attention to the sounds and rhythms of the language.\nI also agree with Benny Lewis’ ideas in\nTHIS ARTICLE\n. On “Step 5”, he says once you’ve watched the film you can review what you’ve learnt or what you are missing with your tutor:\nHere are some ideas of what you can cover with your teacher:\nAsk for help understanding cultural nuances in the film, or why characters are doing specific things that you don’t understand.\nAsk for clarification on phrases or accents that are used in the film.\nHave your teacher ask you questions about a specific segment, then try to answer them in the target language.\nHave your teacher play the part of one of the characters in the movie and practice dialogues with you.\nAsk about the role this film plays in your teacher’s society and culture.\nSo, there you have it! Using movies to learn Spanish is a great way to have fun and improve your language skills at the same time. Whether you prefer movies or series, there are many strategies you can use to get the most out of your movie-watching experience.\nEDIT: I wrote an article with some\nArgentinian flicks recommendations\nHappy watching,\nNext Post »\nWhy do I need a tutor?\nPrevious Post »\nPull one’s socks up | Ponerse las pilas\nYou might also want to read these articles:\nThe Paradox of Choice\nToday, I want to introduce the concept of paradox of choice, and show you how it’s detrimental to your progress.\nArgentinian Spanish Input (part 1)\nIn this post, I included podcasts you can try to leverage your learning with natural input.\nEl que te jedi\nLearn a fun way of saying you-know-who in Rioplatense Spanish.\nInfumable\nHave you heard Argentinians using this word before?

Keep reading!\nExploring the musical landscape of a country is a fascinating journey through its history until the present. For this reason, I’ve tried to put up the most representative artists from Argentina for you to check out.\nAs any list of this kind, it is undeniably subjective and I might be favouring certain artists and leaving out some others worth mentioning, but my goal is to just spark your interest in Argentinian music and point out what a great contribution music might become to your learning.\nI’ve divided the artists in 4 categories in 4 different sections:\nTANGO\nFOLKLORE\nROCK\nand TRAP\nIn each of them tried to offer an overview of the genre as well as include some suggested artists.\nHope you enjoy it!\nTango\nLet’s set off with TANGO.\nAlthough Argentina is linked to tango, it’s not a mainstream genre nowadays. Not many locals enrol for tango dance classes, either. There are traditional tango orchestras which perform regularly, but for most younger generations, it’s the music of our grandparents and what many tourists come after. The big names of Tango were established between the 1920s and 1930s, slowly fading out afterwards.\nThe lyrics of tangos can sometimes be cryptic, as it’s filled with\nlunfardo\n(Argentinian slang) words, but if you take the time to read some of them you can learn a lot. “Cambalache” is a song, which still today, despite having been written in 1934, describes with astonishing accuracy the reality of our times.\nEnrique Santos Discépolo – Cambalache\nSuggested artists:\nCLASSICS – Julio Sosa, Enrique Santos Discepolo, Edmundo Rivero, Carlos Gardel, Hugo del Carril, Roberto Goyeneche, Astor Piazzolla\nMODERN – Orquesta Fernández Fierro, Bajo Fondo Tango Club, Gotan Project\nFolklore\nThere are different subgenres within this general term because folklore expresses differently in\ndifferent regions of the country, with carnavalitos and zambas in the North West, chamamé in the\nNorth East, chacarera in the Central North Region and several others.\nPeñas are places where tourists and locals go to listen to live music and engage in spontaneous\nfolkloric dances.\nAsk any Argentinian and they will mention Mercedes Sosa as the most remarkable representative of what we’ve come to understand as folklore. Her unmistakable voice is soothing and deeply moving.\nAtahualpa Yupanqui is our folklore legend. A gifted guitarist who travelled across the country on a horse and paid homage to the tunes he learnt.\nWatch Mercedes Sosa in one of my favorite performances:\nSuggested artists:\nCLASSICS: Jorge Cafrune, Los Chalchaleros, José Larralde.\nMODERN: Juan Quintero, Chango Spasiuk, Raly Barrionuevo, Soledad Pastorutti.\nRock\nRock music is the genre I personally know best, but it’s really difficult to comprehend.\nThere have been are still are amazing rock bands along the decades, but they are so many I’ll stay\nwith artists who have established themselves as solo artists. All of them have taken part in bands, but\nhave a reputation of their own.\nOne of them is Luis Alberto Spinetta. Recognized by his poetry and complex guitar technique, his\ncareer spans an amazing display of creative power.\nCharly García was very close to him, and he is our present time living legend. Charly García has contributed some of the hymns of our parents’ generation. He and Spinetta wrote “Rezo por vos”.\nIn the late ‘80s Fito Páez started to build a name in the music scene, and his 1992 album, “El amor\ndespués del amor” is the best-selling rock album of all time in Argentina.

Graffitis, flags, people shouting at the top of their lungs. And more…\nI’m not sure about its origins, and the internet doesn’t either, but in my view this phrase has a strong attachment to football and music.\nAguantar, as a verb, means to support, to stand by something. I’m tempted to say it’s like saying ‘Long live x’.\nBut it also means to resist. Our national music hero, Charly García, made an album titled El Aguante, something like ‘The resistance’.\nAlso, you can find\naguantar\nused in many other ways:\nhacer el aguante – to stand by someone\nhay que aguantar – to resist\naguantame 10 minutitos – to wait\n¡aguantá, no seas exagerado! – hold on\nFrom a nerdy side of things, it’s fun that the verb normally doesn’t take the plural form, even when it would make sense that it did:\nAguante los Rolling\nAguante los Redondos\nAguante Soda\nAguante el español rioplatense\nAnd I had missed a Calle 13 song that deals exactly with the verb and its multitude of meanings:\nNacimos para aguantar lo que el cuerpo sostiene\nAguantamos lo que vino y aguantamos lo que viene\nAguantamos aunque tengamos los segundos contados\nNuestro cuerpo aguanta hasta quince minutos ahorcado\nAguantamos latigazos, que nos corten los dos brazos\nFracturas en cualquier hueso, tres semanas con un yeso\nAguantamos todo el tiempo las ganas de ir al baño\nPa ver el cometa Halley, hay que aguantar setenta años\nAguantamos la escuela, la facultad, el instituto\nA la hora de cenar nos aguantamos los eructos\nEl pueblo de Burundi sigue aguantando la hambruna\nAguantamos tres días para llegar a la Luna\nAguantamos el frío del Ártico, el calor del Trópico\nAguantamos con anticuerpos los virus microscópicos\nAguantamos las tormentas, huracanes, el mal clima\nAguantamos Nagasaki, aguantamos Hiroshima\nAunque no queramos, aguantamos nuevas leyes\nAguantamos hoy por hoy que todavía existan reyes\nCastigamos al humilde y aguantamos al cruel\nAguantamos ser esclavos por nuestro color de piel\nAguantamos el capitalismo, el comunismo, el socialismo, el feudalismo\nAguantamos hasta el pendejismo\nAguantamos al culpable cuando se hace el inocente\nAguantamos cada año a nuestro p— presidente\nPor lo que fue y por lo que pudo ser\nPor lo que hay, por lo que puede faltar\nPor lo que venga y por este instante\nA brindar por el aguante\nPor lo que fue y por lo que pudo ser\nPor lo que hay, por lo que puede faltar\nPor lo que venga y por este instante\nLevanta el vaso y a brindar por el aguante\nA brindar por el aguante\nAguantamos cualquier tipo de dolor aunque nos duela\nAguantamos Pinochet, aguantamos a Videla\nA Franco, Mao, Ríos, Mon, Mucabe, Hitler, Idi Amin\nStalin, Bush, Truman, Ariel Sharon y Husein\nAguantamos más de veinte campos de concentración\nCuando nadas bajo el agua aguantas la respiración\nPa construir una pared, aguantamos los ladrillos\nEl que no fuma se aguanta el olor a cigarrillo\nAguantamos que Monsanto infecte nuestra comida\nAguantamos el agente naranja y los pesticidas\nCuando navegamos, aguantamos el mareo\nAguantamos el salario mínimo y el desempleo\nAguantamos las Malvinas y la invasión británica\nEn la ciudad de Pompeya aguantamos lava volcánica\nY dentro de la lógica de nuestra humanidad\nNos creemos la mentira y nadie aguanta la verdad\nPor lo que fue y por lo que pudo ser\nPor lo que hay, por lo que puede faltar\nPor lo que venga y por este instante\nLevanta el vaso y a brindar por el aguante\nA brindar por el aguante\nAguantamos al ateo, al mormón, al cristiano\nAl budista, al judío, aguantamos al pagano\nAguantamos el que vende balas y el que las dispara\nAguantamos la muerte de Lennon, la de Víctor Jara\nAguantamos muchas guerras: Vietnam, la Guerra Fría\nLa Guerra de los Cien Años, la Guerra de los Seis días\nQue aguanten la revancha, venimos al desquite\nHoy nuestro hígado aguanta lo que la barra invite\nPor lo que fue y por lo que pudo ser\nPor lo que hay, por lo que puede faltar\nPor lo que venga y por este instante\nA brindar por el aguante\nPor lo que fue y por lo que pudo ser\nPor lo que hay, por lo que puede faltar\nPor lo que venga y por este instante\nLevanta el vaso y a brindar por el aguante\n¡A brindar por el aguante!\nNext Post »\nThank you in Argentinian Spanish\nPrevious Post »\nArgentinian music | A guide\nYou might also want to read these articles:\nThe Paradox of Choice\nToday, I want to introduce the concept of paradox of choice, and show you how it’s detrimental to your progress.\nArgentinian Spanish Input (part 1)\nIn this post, I included podcasts you can try to leverage your learning with natural input.\nEl que te jedi\nLearn a fun way of saying you-know-who in Rioplatense Spanish.\nInfumable\nHave you heard Argentinians using this word before?

{"url": "https://ventureoutspanish.com/steal-from-the-rich/", "title": "Steal from the rich | Venture Out Spanish", "text": "Steal from the rich\nPost author:\nMatías\nPost published:\nAugust 23, 2024\nReading time:\n4 mins read\nThank you for sharing this post!\nShare this content\nOpens in a new window\nOpens in a new window\nOpens in a new window\nOpens in a new window\nOpens in a new window\nOpens in a new window\nIn music, it’s common to hear the phrase “steal from the rich,” and while I love the phrase in almost any context, it makes even more sense when applied to learning languages, whether it’s music or verbal communication.\nBut what does it mean to “steal from the rich” in language learning?\nThe ‘rich’ in this context are those who excel -those who speak Spanish so well that you can’t help but feel it as an emanation. These are the the ones who’ve mastered the nuances, slang, and flow of the language. Observing them, absorbing their expressions, and even mimicking their speech patterns can be incredibly beneficial for your own learning journey.\nDon’t steal from the poor\nOn the flip side, don’t steal from the poor.\nIn other words, avoid picking up bad habits or broken Spanish from those who struggle with the language. The internet is full of that, whenever you’re reading this.\nThere’s nothing more detrimental to your progress than adopting poor grammar, mispronunciations, or awkward phrasing. It’s essential to discern quality sources from which to learn.\nSure, this might sound easier said than done. But if you pay attention, you can tell who the “rich” are in any linguistic environment. Look for those who speak confidently, use a wide range of vocabulary, and seem at ease in conversations.\nTake their strengths and make them your own. It’s the best kind of theft -one that enriches you without taking anything away from others.\nWhere to find The rich?\nFinding “the rich” in language isn’t about pinpointing exact locations or individuals -it’s about being mindful of the environments where high-quality language is most likely to be found. Look for spaces where Spanish is spoken naturally and confidently.\nOne resource I’d like to suggest, though, is Caja Negra. Caja Negra is an interview YT show where interviewers are given the space to ellaborate on their answers. This does not mean all of them are articulate and imitable, but it’s a good starting place.\nIf not Caja Negra, immerse yourself in contexts where the language flows freely, but in a way that it makes sense.\nAnd it does not only come to listening, you can also look for ‘the rich’ in writing.\nIn essence, ‘the rich’ are all around you if you know where to look. It’s not about finding the perfect teacher, but about exposing yourself to the right influences. So, open your ears, tune into the best sources, and start “stealing” those valuable language skills.\nLeave a Reply\nCancel reply\nComment\nEnter your name or username to comment\nEnter your email address to comment\nEnter your website URL (optional)\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment."}

Nothing fancy, yet incredibly powerful.\nMost of such lessons I teach, unless there’s a specific topic to cover, are spontaneous and guided by what naturally comes up.\nOver the years, I’ve had countless hours of conversation lessons with my students, and I can confidently state that many of them were so much better than conversations I can have with friends or family, people I know at a personal level.\nTypically, in my lessons, I use the chat on whatever platform we are using to take notes and provide students with feedback, vocabulary and reference.\nSome of them are really great at picking up corrections and new words, but what I see sometimes happening is that in the heat of the conversation, corrections go unnoticed and then the same mistakes pop up.\nIt’s natural that unless you come back to your notes, most of what was said in class will vanish, so a good rule to follow is always revise the notes and try to link them to the context when they were used.\nBut also, at this point in time a wise question to ask is “how can GPT help me with this?”\nSo I did. And I think his(?) assistance is valuable. Look:\nME\nI study spanish online. the following is a saved chat from one of my lessons.

You can create sentences or short paragraphs incorporating them to reinforce your understanding. Additionally, consider using flashcards or mnemonic devices to help memorize the vocabulary. Let me know if you need further assistance with anything!\nME\nI like this. how else can you help me with this?\nChatGPT\nI’m glad you found that helpful! Here are a few more ways I can assist you in organizing and enhancing your learning:\nFlashcards Creation\n: I can help you create digital flashcards with the Spanish words on one side and their English translations or definitions on the other side. Flashcards are a great way to reinforce vocabulary retention through spaced repetition.\nSentence Building\n: We can work on constructing sentences using the vocabulary and expressions you’ve learned. I can provide feedback on your sentences to ensure they are grammatically correct and contextually appropriate.\nPractice Conversations\n: We can engage in simulated conversations where I act as a Spanish speaker, and you can practice using the vocabulary and expressions you’ve learned in context. This can help improve your speaking and listening skills.\nQuiz and Review\n: I can create quizzes or review exercises based on the vocabulary and expressions you’ve learned to test your understanding and retention.\nCultural Context\n: For certain expressions or phrases that have cultural significance or context, I can provide additional information to help you understand their usage better.\nLet me know which option interests you, or if there’s anything else specific you’d like assistance with!\nME\nCan you give me an example of each?\nChatGPT\nOf course! Here are examples of each of the options I mentioned:\nFlashcards Creation\n:\nFront side: “está llegando”\nBack side: “is arriving”\nYou can create similar flashcards for each word or expression and use them for practice.\nSentence Building\n:\nUsing the word “empujar”: “Tuve que empujar el coche para sacarlo del barro.” (I had to push the car to get it out of the mud.)\nConstructing sentences helps reinforce vocabulary and grammar rules.\nPractice Conversations\n:\nSimulated Conversation:\nYou: “¿Puedes traer a consciencia lo que hiciste?”\nMe: “Sí, lo siento mucho por eso.” (Can you bring to consciousness what you did? / Yes, I’m really sorry about that.)\nPracticing conversations allows you to apply vocabulary and expressions in real-life situations.\nQuiz and Review\n:\nQuiz Question: What does “almohadones” mean?\nAnswer Options: a) pillows b) chairs c) tables d) curtains\nReviewing through quizzes helps reinforce learning and assess understanding.\nCultural Context\n:\nExplanation: “Pituca” is a colloquial term in some Latin American countries, often used to describe someone who is perceived as snobbish or pretentious. It’s important to understand the cultural context when encountering such terms.\nIt’s definitely worth giving it a try.

Fast forward to December, and you wouldn’t believe how far he has come.\nHe’s put a lot of hard work and dedication, and he’s spent time and stayed curious all the way through. The best about being immersed in your target language is that you are surrounded by it, you just can’t avoid it. All your waking hours (at least your waking hours) are Spanish waking hours.\nI like it when he comes to class with a purebred Argentinian word or phrase he overheard on the street or read online.\nThe other day we were commenting on the varied and surprising uses of the word CARAJO. He said it would make a good idea for a book: “The 73 different uses of carajo”. I don’t how many different and creative ways of using this word are possible, but here are a few:\nMe importa un carajo\n| I don’t give a fuck. ‘Me importa un carajo si gana Argentina.’ Sometimes we turn this phrase into\ntres carajos\n.\n¡Vamos carajo!\n| A phrase we use to celebrate good news or events. If Argentina’s national team or your football team wins a difficult match, we say ‘¡Vamos Argentina/Boca/Racing, carajo!’\nAndate al carajo\n| Fuck off. Still, we have so many variations to this ‘invitation’ that I should probably write a whole post on it.\nMe mandó al carajo, La mandé al carajo, Lo mandé al carajo, Los mandé al carajo, Las mandé al carajo\n| The reported phrase for the previous.\n¿Qué carajo es esto?\n| What the heck is this?\nNo valer un carajo\n| This is not worth a penny. ‘No vale un carajo.’\nNo valer de un carajo\n| To be useless. ‘¿Para qué me voy a enojar? No vale de un carajo.’\nTener un talento del carajo\n| To be very talented. ‘Lucas tiene un talento del carajo para la música.’\nNo durar un carajo\n| Usually to say that something has a short life. ‘La batería de mi celular no dura un carajo.’\nNo entender un carajo\n| When you have no clue, this is the standard phrase. ‘No entendí un carajo lo que dijo.’\nIrse al carajo\n| This phrase can have a positive or negative meaning. The intonation is very important here. When someone crosses the line, we say ‘Te fuiste al carajo, boludo.’\nCarajear\n| Last, we have the verb. Carajear means to treat someone in a derogatory manner.\nBe ready to hear this and discover other usess of CARAJO in your visit to Argentina. Like I always say when we discuss curse words, don’t try to use them yourself unless you are with friends (or very angry!).

Mingled with long time friends, home maintanance services and family, the foreign (yet by now familiar) names of my students van apareciendo. Es increíble pensar en las conexiones que llevo hechas en mis años de enseñar español.\nI’ll give you this picture: someone who’s found you sailing the immense ocean known as the internet decides to meet you based on a very limited set of alleged qualities you’ve described yourself with.\nWe both jump on that first lesson, smile, say the hellos in the best available way and the adventure starts. Next thing you know, that student confides in you about their goal: they want to speak Spanish. You listen to their stories (I’m here for the stories, to be honest) and try to establish a common ground from where to start building.\nA lot goes on in the middle. You discuss learning strategies, you discuss grammar, idiomatic use of the language, explore the sounds, contrast Spanish against their native language. You talk. A lot.\nFast forward to the moment when you spend an hour speaking Spanish with barely any English mixed in. The goal has been achieved.\nThe learner is stoked.\nFor you, as the tutor, it feels as thrilling. You’ve witnessed their journey.\nIt feels so good, amigos!\nYou’ve gotten to know them at a personal level. And they’ve gotten to know you. Probably that’s the secret. We need the human element in everything we do. You know quite a lot about them; about their work, their interests, their travels, their family, their weekend activities. The movies and food they like and dislike.\nAll of that has been going on while Spanish slowly and organically took over. This new Spanish speaking self that you’ve created is now available to you. So so rewarding, friends.\nAs of September of 2024 I’ve taught over 200 students from all over the world— places I couldn’t even have placed on a map. Cities I’d never heard of before now sound so familiar to me.\nStudents from/living in Alaska, Canada, the USA, Mexico, Grenada, Panama, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Spain, Portugal, France, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Croatia, Slovakia, Georgia, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Egypt, Morocco, Israel, Syria, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Kazakhstan, China, Japan, the Philipinnes, Australia and some others I might be forgetting now as I bring them to memory with gratitude.\nCan you make friends with your students/tutor? With some of them I’ve been meeting regularly for the past 3/4 years! For sure you can!\nI’ve heard so many great stories, I’ve had so many awesome conversations. I’ve learned so much!\nI’ve always liked the the term ‘jack of all trades’. I’m not sure someone looking at me from the outside would consider me one, but I do.\nEarlie this year I read a quote that illuminated an idea I’d been hovering around for a while: it’s your personal sum of skills, not one particular superskill which opens doors and makes you quien sos.\n“Excellence is mundane. Superlative performance is really a confluence of dozens of small skills or activities, each one learned or stumbled upon, which have been carefully drilled into habit and then are fitted together in a synthesized whole. There is nothing extraordinary or superhuman in any one of those actions; only the fact that they are done consistently and correctly, and all together, produce excellence.”\nWhen I enrolled in university to study law, my plan was to pursue a diplomatic career. That never came to be exactly on those literal terms, but on a higher, more rewarding octave it has. I like to think doing what I do I play a diplomatic role.\nI graduated from university in 2011 and started my teaching journey working in 2012 in Brazil as a Spanish teacher for hotel staff. I had no idea how to go about it, but a Brazilian friend who was teaching English there said I was a good fit (the basic and not always accurate assumption that natives know best).\nI worked at two big hotels for two months, and when I returned to Argentina, I wanted to get one of those colorful papers that say you can do something.\nI got my Spanish teaching diploma, but for the next few years, I mostly taught English to Argentine students aged… 10-70 in group lessons. It was awesome offline teaching training, but with the pandemic we switched to online courses. The first month I was pissed. I thought that’d never work.\nBut then my brother, who lives in Denmark, suggested I taught Spanish to his Danish girlfriend and one Swedish friend.\nSoon after that I applied to teach on Italki, and one year later,\nvoila!\n, Venture Out started to take shape in my mind.\nTeaching English helped me set up for success in teaching español and at the same time, teaching Spanish transformed the way I approach teaching inglés nowadays.\nBy then, I was still living in the western area of the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area. When my wife and I decided to move to Córdoba, I decided to double down on AR Spanish.\nBy zeroing in on Argentinian Spanish I discovered a rich field of language and culture I’d never taken for granted (thanks to having travelled much through South America in my younger years), but had never bothered to disect rigorously, either.\nI started Traé Alfajores to discuss Argentinian Spanish, and debunk some common misconceptions. The podcast ended up being my favorite excuse to combine my interest in radio broadcasting, my fascination with the internet and my tendency to look at everything halfway between an alien and an anthropologist.\nAt 270 followers, the podcast analytics say TA gets listens from every corner of the world! Latvia, Kuwait, Zambia, Vanuatu…\nThe prerequisite for having an online business is being out there and the second and most essential one is being discovered. I did my homework on that area, too. Not only did I learn much about web development, but also about SEO.\nAlso, thanks to my website blog I get to write regularly in English, touching on topics that make me a better learner.\nI grew up surrounded by English. My mother is an English teacher, and every time we traveled abroad, I saw the value of English in real life. Then I started learning Portuguese at school and continued for quite a few years and lived in Brazil for 6 months. Next up is either German or Italian, but knowing what it takes, I recognize I’m not fully available.\nHowever, as of 2024 drums are back in my life and pretty much everything I say about learning a language applies to the language of drumming.\nI’m taking lessons from a guy who has been a gamechanger in my view about music. He has an approach which he calls creative flow. Basically, it means simple ideas creating complex grooves. That’s exactly how I feel about Spanish learning.\nI know this was a long, self-referential post, but I’m happy to share it with whoever made it to the end.\nThanks for reading and for being on the other end, especially to those who have been supporting my work in one way or another.\nHope you have a great day ahead,\nMati\nNext Post »\nPapelón\nPrevious Post »\nEstar en una\nYou might also want to read these articles:\nThe Paradox of Choice\nToday, I want to introduce the concept of paradox of choice, and show you how it’s detrimental to your progress.\nArgentinian Spanish Input (part 1)\nIn this post, I included podcasts you can try to leverage your learning with natural input.\nEl que te jedi\nLearn a fun way of saying you-know-who in Rioplatense Spanish.\nInfumable\nHave you heard Argentinians using this word before?

{"url": "https://ventureoutspanish.com/how-to-get-fluent-in-spanish/", "title": "How to get fluent in Spanish? | Venture Out Spanish", "text": "How to get fluent in Spanish?\nPost author:\nMatías\nPost published:\nAugust 2, 2023\nReading time:\n10 mins read\nThank you for sharing this post!\nShare this content\nOpens in a new window\nOpens in a new window\nOpens in a new window\nOpens in a new window\nOpens in a new window\nOpens in a new window\nAre we ready to tackle the million dollar question? I think so!\nDISCLAIMER: Let’s get the bad news out of the way first. As of August 2023, there’s no magic pill to learn a language, let alone get fluent.\nLanguage tutors get this question asked all the time by their students, and reasonably expected to provide a definitive answer.\nHey Mati, your’re the teacher\n.\nHowever, I don’t feel it’s the type of question that should be outsourced. At least not straight away.\nThe thing is, if you expect someone to answer the question before you answer it yourself, you’re on the wrong path to fluency. Given that you’re a fluent speaker of your native language and fluency refers to the same type of compound skills irrespective of the specific language you’re learning:\nHow do you become fluent?\nLet’s skip the ‘baby magic’ part and try to answer the question from the standpoint of an adult learner. What would you recommend a student of your language to get fluent?\nWell, you may say, we would first have to come to a definition of fluency.\nHere it is:\nFluency means having enough language flexibility to express yourself effectively in a conversation. To be understdood and not get stuck in the frustration of not knowing how to say what you want to say.\nCertainly, language learning is continuous, and as learners gain more experience and exposure, their fluency can evolve and improve. But this is the starting point.\nSo, again, how do you become fluent?\nOnly by immersing yourself in the language?\nOnly by speaking with native speakers of your target language?\nOnly by doing a lot of grammar practice and drills?\nYou’ll probably agree it’s undoubtedly a tough nut to crack.\nAdd to the inherent complexity of the question the traditional view of a teacher.\nYou see, there’s this basic idea that teaching works like this:\nPerson A → Person B\nPerson A, who has information, passes it on to Person B, who knows little or less than Person A. Person B hopes that Person A will be able to teach them all there’s to learn to eventually become a fluent speaker.\nThis model might hold true for other things, but language learning does not follow such straightforward path.\nAnyway, I’m not doing this to tell you there’s nothing you can do to achieve fluency or dodge the question. I do want to share you my thoughts.\nI feel there’s a difference if the person asking the question is an elementary student or a more intermediate learner, and have come up with two different pieces of advice for each case.\nPlease, follow me this way.\nElementary students\nFor beginners or those just getting the hang of Spanish, I recommend keeping fluency as the ultimate goal, but not to make it your next stop. It’s crucial to remember that fluency primarily involves knowing how to use the language flexibly enough to feel comfortable, so you can’t expect fluency without a bare minimum.\nThis is where language learning proves to be less fun than the student anticipated. Patience and persistance are not optional to attain success!\nSome beginner students don’t feel overwhelmed when exposed to their target language through\nNatural Input\n, and have faith (never let go faith, amigos) in themselves being able to gradually make sense of it, but most feel unprepared to do it or frustrated when they do it. Encouraging these type of students to embrace natural input is often a difficult task, as they’re usually students that have a learning style anchored in traditional teaching.\nNatural input is the difficult type of ‘first try it for yourself without bias and then decide’ strategy, but one that should not be so frowned upon is the\nAuthentic Interaction Strategy\nI presented on a previous post. In short, It involves brainstorming the many everyday phrases you need to get by, and do things like talk about yourself, find about others, or react to questions or information focusing on chunks rather than on smaller parts of speech.\nThis gives you a shortcut to fluency in simple steps available to anyone willing to give it a try.\nHowever, students sometimes think of it like cheating, or something like that. If that feeling taker over, then GAME OVER.\nIntermediate students\nNow, if the student has hit the intermediate plateau and doesn’t know where to go next, I’d first check how they’ve gotten where they are now. There’s a high chance that they\nknow\nmore than they can put down to use. Often, learners who find themselves in this situation possess more knowledge than they realize but may struggle to apply it effectively. Many learners seeking out help to reach fluency are people that didn’t plan their journey in the most convenient way, i.e, they thought they had to focus on grammar and data before tackling the nasty fluency challenge.\nThere are, however, cases where the person wants to go beyond their current conversational skills, And when it comes to this part, the most simple and most effective way is:\na) immersing yourself in Spanish and\nb) having as many conversations in Spanish with a native speaker as you possibly can.\nThe conversation partner need not necessarily be a tutor but should have the ability to correct mistakes, provide constructive feedback on pronunciation and areas for improvement, and introduce common phrases and expressions not commonly found in formal resources.\nPaths to explore toward fluency from your home\nAlthough immersing yourself in a Spanish speaking country is unparalled, you don’t even need to leave your home to start making progress. You can try one or several of this suggested routes:\nPractice Regularly\n: Consistency is key. Practice Spanish regularly, even if it’s just for a few minutes every day. Regular practice helps reinforce what you’ve learned and keeps the language fresh in your mind.\nLanguage Learning Apps\n: Use language learning apps like Busuu (my favorite), Duolingo or others available. These apps offer gamified learning experiences with interactive exercises and regular challenges to keep you engaged.\nVirtual Language Exchange\n: Join language exchange platforms like Tandem or Hello Talk where you can connect with native Spanish speakers who want to learn your native language.\nOnline Tutors\n: Hire an online Spanish tutor or join virtual group classes. Tutors can provide personalized instruction, feedback, and conversation practice to accelerate your language skills.\nOnline Language Forums\n: Participate in online Spanish language forums (I like Reddit’s\nSpanish\n) and social media groups where learners and native speakers interact. Engaging in discussions and asking questions can improve your understanding and fluency.\nConsistent Practice\n: Dedicate a fixed amount of time each day to practice Spanish. Whether it’s 15 minutes or an hour, regular practice is crucial for language retention and improvement.\nLanguage Challenges\n: Set specific language learning goals and challenges for yourself. For example, aim to watch a Spanish movie without subtitles, write a short story entirely in Spanish, or hold a conversation with a native speaker for 10 minutes.\nFlashcards and Vocabulary Apps\n: Use flashcard apps like Anki or Quizlet to reinforce vocabulary and review new words regularly. Remember to always learn new words in context.\nYouTube Language Lessons\n: Access free Spanish language lessons on YouTube. Many educators and language schools offer excellent resources for language learners.\nI wrote an article that resonates with this one:\nThe role of grammar, your tutor and input in all this mess\n.

Today, I want to share with you a language learning approach that might contribute to your developing of Spanish skills. It’s all about the mighty power of verbs! I can assure you that by focusing on verbs, you’ll unlock the door to countless related abilities.\nYou know why verbs are awesome vocabulary builders? Because verbs you can’t make a sentence without a verb. The very basic ingredients of a sentence are a subject and a verb.\nGood old SUBJECT/PREDICATE to the rescue\nLet’s refresh. The predicate, whose nucleus is always a verb, tells you something about the subject. If you are able to spot the verb, you can ask\nwho performs this action?\nand automatically identify the subject of virtually any sentence. I talk about this in more detail\nHERE\n.\nBy embracing verbs as your starting point, you’ll open the floodgates to understanding the language’s fundamental structure and gaining fluency faster.\nVerb Patterns\nWhen you prioritize verbs, you tap into a goldmine of patterns.\nVerbs don’t exist in isolation; they need to team up with other words. These combinations play a crucial role in expanding your vocabulary.\nUnderstanding the different type of verbs out there, you’ll be able to know how they relate to other types of words.\nThere’re several different classifications of verbs, but the ones I consider relevant for this purpose are the following:\nTransitive / Intransitive\nPronominal / Non Pronominal\nPrepositional verbs\nVerb Periphrasis\nOf course, how would this be complete if we didn’t include verb periphrasis?\nI cannot stress enough the importance of verb periphrasis. Make yourself familiar with, at least, the following:\nDe INFINITIVO\nIR A + INF\nVOLVER A +INF\nDEJAR DE + INF\nEMPEZAR A + INF\nCOMENZAR A + INF\nPODER + INF\nQUERER + INF\nTRATAR DE + INF\nINTENTAR + INF\nTENER QUE + INF\nHAY QUE + INF\nESTAR POR + INF\nACABAR DE + INF\nAPRENDER A + INF\nDe GERUNDIO\nESTAR  + GER\nSEGUIR + GER\nVIVIR + GER\nDe PARTICIPIO\nESTAR + PART\nLLEVAR + PART\nCollocations\nLearning verbs alongside their common collocations and idiomatic expressions will boost your conversational skills and help you sound more natural and fluent.\nAs you discover more verbs, you’ll start seeing these patterns emerge again and again, helping you master conjugation effortlessly.\nThe best way to do this is to take any given verb and pair it to their most common direct objects.\nEmbrace Verb Conjugation Exercises\nTo solidify your grasp of verb forms, it’s essential to practice conjugation regularly. Seek out exercises, online resources, or textbooks that provide conjugation drills.\nWork on different verb tenses, persons, and moods. With consistent practice, conjugation will become second nature, and you’ll gain the confidence to use verbs accurately in your own speech and writing.\nVerbs in Context: Authentic Material\nOne of the most effective ways to internalize verbs is by immersing yourself in\nauthentic Spanish sources\n. Listen to podcasts, watch movies, try to connect with native speakers, and read books and articles in Spanish. By experiencing verbs in real-life contexts, you’ll grasp their nuances, understand their usage, and effortlessly absorb new vocabulary.\nThis is it my friends! I hope I’ve encouraged you to take action on verbs. They are your allies in the journey of language learning.\n¡Buena suerte!\nNext Post »\nWhat does CARETA mean?\nPrevious Post »\nMirá vos\nYou might also want to read these articles:\nThe Paradox of Choice\nToday, I want to introduce the concept of paradox of choice, and show you how it’s detrimental to your progress.\nArgentinian Spanish Input (part 1)\nIn this post, I included podcasts you can try to leverage your learning with natural input.\nEl que te jedi\nLearn a fun way of saying you-know-who in Rioplatense Spanish.\nInfumable\nHave you heard Argentinians using this word before?

When you listen, you only activate your passive listening skills. Lastly, when you speak, you’re often so focused on keeping the conversation going that you don’t have enough CPU power to refine your pronunciation and intonation.\nSHADOWING brings together the best of all three worlds, giving you the chance to become familiar with new words and sentence structures.\nGetting started\nSo, how should you get started with shadowing? What’s involved in a shadowing session?\nIt’s essential to have access to a resource that offers both a written layer and a spoken layer. Ideally, it should be a human language model.\nYou can look for movie scripts, audiobooks, YouTube videos or podcast that offer transcripts.\nIn a shadowing session, there are several stages. The first stage involves working with the written resource as reading material. It’s fundamental to invest time in dissecting it before proceeding to the listening section and, ultimately, the speaking section.\nOnce you’ve read the transcript, analyze it considering it as any reading material. Make the most out of new vocabulary and highlight those new words.\nThen, listen to the track for the first time. As you listen, pay attention to how words are grouped together. You can mark these semantic blocks to better understand the flow of the speech.\nAlso, pay attention to parts of the sentences where intonation rises or falls.\nYou’re now ready to do your own recording of the text representing the original audio aiming to replicate the original audio as closely as possible.\nBest practices\nThese are the steps to a perfect shadowing session:\n#1 choose your resource\ninterview, vlog, podcast + accurate transcript\nthings to consider:\ntopic\ncomplexity\naccent\nmale/female\nlength\nspeed\ncontext\nclarity of audio\n#2 analyze it\nidentify new words\nidentify semantic blocks (groups of words that are clustered together because they share a common meaning or are related in a specific context.)\n#3 listen to it\nunderline difficult words in terms of pronunciation\nmark intonation\nmark stressed words\n#4 relisten\ncheck for nuances you may have missed\n#5 record yourself\nmake sure you are monitoring the original audio with earphones so it doesn’t get mixed with your voice\nthe best option is probably to monitor from your computer and record from your phone\n#6 listen and compare\nplay the file and see if you missed something\n#7 re-record yourself until you feel it’s perfect\nif needed, do a second, and perhaps even a third take\nNot sure where to start? Try\nTRAÉ ALFAJORES\n. You’ll have access to the free transcripts and do your first shadowing session.\nI hope this article persuades you to try SHADOWING real soon.\nHappy learning,\nNext Post »\nImplied subject\nPrevious Post »\nArgentinian Provinces and Demonyms\nYou might also want to read these articles:\nThe Paradox of Choice\nToday, I want to introduce the concept of paradox of choice, and show you how it’s detrimental to your progress.\nArgentinian Spanish Input (part 1)\nIn this post, I included podcasts you can try to leverage your learning with natural input.\nEl que te jedi\nLearn a fun way of saying you-know-who in Rioplatense Spanish.\nInfumable\nHave you heard Argentinians using this word before?

Because patterns provide the framework that makes using a language possible. A language is, in essence, a set of patterns. I like to highlight patterns whenever possible to show that a language is not a random set of words mixed together, but a system where each word or block of words is a gear tooth.\nPatterns can be an incredibly useful tool when learning Spanish. They can help you easily memorize words and phrases, make the language more understandable, help you speak more naturally, and make learning more effective.\nPatterns are closely related to syntax. In short, syntax is what sets the ground for what is and what is not possible in a language.\nNow, before we move on let’s see why patterns are so powerful:\nPatterns make language more understandable\nWhen learning a new language, it can be overwhelming to try to understand and remember all of the words, phrases, and grammar rules. Patterns can help make the language more understandable and approachable.\nBy understanding the patterns and recognizing them in context, you can quickly and easily decipher words and phrases.\nPatterns help you use the language more naturally\nWhen using Spanish, you want to sound natural and fluent. Patterns can help you do this.\nBy understanding the patterns of the language , you can easily construct sentences that sound more natural and fluid. This helps you sound more like a native speaker and makes communication much easier.\nPatterns Help You Memorize\nPatterns help you learn and memorize the language. Spanish has a number of patterns, including verb conjugations, and word order and fixed expressions.\nLearning and recognizing these patterns can help you quickly and easily recall words, phrases, and grammar rules.\nPatterns make learning fun\nMaybe it’s only me, but it’s like detective work. When I spot a pattern I feel as if I have solved a case. Patterns can make language learning fun. Instead of just memorizing words and phrases, you can use patterns to understand the language and make it your own.\nSOME COMMON PATTERNS\nS + V + O (Sujeto + Verbo + Objeto)\nS + V + CD (Sujeto + Verbo + Complemento Directo)\nS + P + V (Sujeto + Pronombre + Verbo)\nS + V + FP (Sujeto + Verbo + Frase Preposicional)\nS + V + INF (Sujeto + Verbo + Infinitivo)\nS + V + GER (Sujeto + Verbo + Gerundio)\nS + V + PREP + OBJ (Sujeto + Objeto + Preposición + Objeto)\nSVO + CC (Sujeto + Verbo + Objeto + Complemento Circunstancial*)\nSV + DO + IO (Sujeto + Verbo + Objeto Indirecto + Objeto Directo)\nS + PR + V (Sujeto + Verbo + Objeto Indirecto + Objeto Directo)\nExtending your phrases\nS + V + O + que + S + V\nSVO + y + SVO\nSVO + pero + SVO\nSVO + porque + SVO\naunque + SVO + , + SVO\nsi + Condición + , + Consecuencia\nIMPERATIVO AFIRMATIVO + (OD/OI) (Imperativo + Objeto Directo/Indirecto)\nNO + PRESENTE DEL SUBJUNTIVO + (OD/OI)\nI hope I’ve encouraged you to look for patterns in case you’re not doing it already,\nGive it a try,\nTalk soon!\nNext Post »\nShorten words in the Argentinian style\nPrevious Post »\nVESRES in Porteño Spanish\nYou might also want to read these articles:\nThe Paradox of Choice\nToday, I want to introduce the concept of paradox of choice, and show you how it’s detrimental to your progress.\nArgentinian Spanish Input (part 1)\nIn this post, I included podcasts you can try to leverage your learning with natural input.\nEl que te jedi\nLearn a fun way of saying you-know-who in Rioplatense Spanish.\nInfumable\nHave you heard Argentinians using this word before?

On the other hand, languages such as German, French and English, don’r do that.\nAt least in Spanish, the reason why we can drop the subject is because the verb carries much more information than in English. You need only see/hear the form of the verb to understand who the subject is in a particular sentence.\nSo, next time you have to choose between:\nYo me llamo x\nand\nMe llamo x\n, go for the second.\nStart small and then scale it up!\nGood luck!\nNext Post »\nHow to go about with reading in Spanish\nPrevious Post »\nStart Shadowing now!\nYou might also want to read these articles:\nThe Paradox of Choice\nToday, I want to introduce the concept of paradox of choice, and show you how it’s detrimental to your progress.\nArgentinian Spanish Input (part 1)\nIn this post, I included podcasts you can try to leverage your learning with natural input.\nEl que te jedi\nLearn a fun way of saying you-know-who in Rioplatense Spanish.\nInfumable\nHave you heard Argentinians using this word before?

This can lead to feelings of frustration or anxiety when you encounter written Spanish, I know.\nEverybody experiences this, believe it or not!\nAs you already know, or are about to discover, language learning requires a lot of effort. However, you can start reading in Spanish right away, and even enjoy it.\nIf you use a Chrome extension like Imtranslator, you’ll be able to read in (almost) the same relaxed way that you do in English or in your own language; you will have to really work at it. It may feel very challenging at first, but it will be worth it, I promise.\nIn a separate article, I have discussed different ways of using\nImtranslator\n(which I highly recommend) to interact with authentic materials and create interlinear texts.\nHere, however, I am talking about a more basic approach.\nI want you to be able to identify the basic components of a sentence, which are sometimes referred to as ‘chunks’. You see, language is all about\npatterns\n, and if you can recognize the patterns early, you will be better able to understand how words fit together. Of course, your understanding of Spanish will improve dramatically.\nHow to go about it then? Well, imagination and humility play a key role here. I like to say it’s detective work – you’ll have to decide what’s essential and what’s accessory in a sentence, while staying positive.\nIt is important that you don’t start your session expecting to magically understand all that you read, but rather be eager to give it your best shot and exercise independence along the way. The guiding word here is ‘deduction’ – follow the clues and see where they lead you.\nIt’s a good idea to recognize subjects and verbs first. Most generally than not, ‘subject’ and ‘verb’ are more than one word. For this reason, what you really should be looking for is:\nGRUPOS NOMINALES (NOUN PHRASES)\nGRUPOS VERBALES (VERB PHRASES)\nWe tend to think that when we break a sentence into smaller pieces, we get just words. In reality we are left with groups of words revolving around a specific other type of word (a noun, a verb, an adjective, an adverb or a preposition).\nTherefore, it is important to identify noun phrases and verb phrases first. This is how you will humblely start off. The noun will tell you\nwho\nand verb will tell you\nwhat\n.\nVerbs are the real heroes in Spanish. They even carry the information we need to make out the subject even when it’s not stated explicitly— and this is more common than not.\nVerbs don’t usually look the same, as they change their forms from tense to tense, but we can recognize regular verbs by looking at their stem (the first letters in the verb) which is a great opportunity to get familiar with them along the way.\nIf you can’t identify any of these two blocks of your sentence, re-read it considering the following possibilities:\nTry to find a connection between the words in the text and words you know in English.\nGuide yourself with all possible context cues.\nChoose the word which you guess will open more doors for you and look it up in a dictionary.\nAlso remember that a sentence is essentially made up of groups of words.\nYou can guide yourself with suffixes to spot the different ‘word species’.\nSpot NOUNS\n-ción / -sión\n-or\n-ista\n-ía\n-ura\n-dad\n-ismo\n-ería\n-ancia\n-bilidad\n-dor\n-ero\n-itud\n-ía\nSpot VERBS\n-ar\n-er\n-ir\n-ando\n-iendo\npre-\nre-\nSpot ADVERBS of manner\n-mente\nSpot ADJECTIVES\n-able\n-ible\n-ado | -ido (consider if it can be a participle)\n-ador\n-al\n-ano\n-ante\n-ente\n-ar (check if it’s not an infinitive)\n-ento\n-dor\n-izo\ndes-\nim-\nin-\na-\nan-\nanti-\npre-\nYou can use color coding like this if you want:\nYellow: verbs\nPink: nouns\nGreen: words that look like words you know in English\nLight Blue: articles, prepositions, pronouns\nRed: connectors\nGeneral guidelines:\nRead short pieces (+/- 250 words)\nAvoid:\nWanting to understand each word in a sentence. It’s not failing\nfeeling overwhelmed by all the words you don’t know yet.

The list below is living proof:\n¡Qué mierda!\n: This phrase is an expression of frustration, anger, or annoyance. It’s used when something goes wrong or is undesirable.\nUna mierda\n: This translates to “a piece of shit” or “crap.” It’s used to describe something as worthless, bad, or of poor quality.\n[noun] + de mierda\n: This translates to “of shit” or “shitty.” It’s used as an adjective to express dissatisfaction with something.\nMucha mierda\n: This is the equivalent of the English phrase “break a leg.” It’s used to wish someone good luck, particularly before a performance, test or event.\nHacerse mierda\n: I guess this phrase literally translates to “to turn to shit.” It’s a colloquial expression used to describe a violent or severe accident or to indicate that someone or something has been severely damaged or destroyed.\nIn some expressions, MIERDA and\nCARAJO\nare closely knit together\nMandar a la mierda/al carajo a alguien\n: These phrases mean “to tell someone to go fuck themselves.” They are strong expressions of anger or frustration and are used to dismiss or reject someone in a rude or offensive manner.\nIrse a la mierda/al carajo:\nYou would use these phrases to tell someone they crossed a line. Interestingly enough, when someone makes a positively surprising thing (for example they give us an important present) we sometimes also use it.\nI hope you understand why I thought it was necessary to get into this after my last article on the body and bodily functions.\nUntil next time!\nNext Post »\nEstar chocho/a\nPrevious Post »\nThe body and bodily functions\nYou might also want to read these articles:\nThe Paradox of Choice\nToday, I want to introduce the concept of paradox of choice, and show you how it’s detrimental to your progress.\nArgentinian Spanish Input (part 1)\nIn this post, I included podcasts you can try to leverage your learning with natural input.\nEl que te jedi\nLearn a fun way of saying you-know-who in Rioplatense Spanish.\nInfumable\nHave you heard Argentinians using this word before?

Dirty words. Bad words. Enter at your own risk.\nWe Argentinians are famously passionate, and our language reflects this —our curse words are particularly colorful and melodious. And quite inventive, too!\nI can’t state this categorically, but Argentinians’s use of curse words is above average. It’s not just\nBOLUDO\n,\nCARAJO\nand\nLA PUTA MADRE\nthat made it into mainstream speech, no no.\nIn this post I’m going to walk you through a side of a foreign language that challenges the idea that there are ‘bad words’. Rather, it seems they are\ngood words\nin specific contexts and situations.\nWith this goal in mind, I’ll try to introduce you to some of the many words in the family and at the same time give you some reference on regards to how they are often used.\nI’m talking to you, and I’m angry\nThe words listed below can be grouped together considering that they are all normally used to address someone we believe deserves our verbal attacks for one reason or another.\nIt’s extremely difficult to find the exact equivalent for them, as they all revolve around the basic assumption that the other person is either a) stupid b) malicious c) someone we want to offend d) all the previous options.\nBOLUDO/A\nPELOTUDO/A\nFORRO/A\nHIJO/A DE (RE MIL) PUTA\nTARADO/A\nESTÚPIDO/A\nIMBÉCIL\nPAJERO/A\nCONCHUDA\nMALCOGIDO/A\nCORNUDO\nPUTO\nPUTA\nLA PUTA QUE TE PARIÓ\nLA CONCHA DE TU MADRE\nLA CONCHA DE TU HERMANA\nSORETE\nI’m not talking to anyone in particular, I’m just angry\nThe words below are used without addressing them to a specific recipient and are mostly used to show anger. We could say they serve a therapeutic purpose.\nLA PUTA MADRE\nME CAGO EN LA PUTA MADRE\nLA RE PUTA MADRE\nLA REPUTÍSIMA MADRE\nLA (RE) CONCHA DE LA LORA\nGo-to formulas\nNow, let’s see the multiple applications for these nice little words:\n¡Sos un/una + [CURSE WORD]!\nSos un/una\nboludo/a\npelotudo/a\nforro/a\nhijo/a de puta\ntarado/a\nestúpido/a\npajero/a\nconchuda\nmalcogido/a\nputo\nputa\nsorete (mal cagado)\n¡Qué + [CURSE WORD ] + DE MIERDA!\n¡Qué\nforro/a\nde mierda!\nboludo/a\npelotudo/a\ntarado/a\n¡Qué + [WORD THAT EXPRESSES AMOUNT] + [CURSE WORD]!\n¡Qué\npedazo de\nboludo/a!\nflor de\npelotudo/a!\nreverendo\nforro/a!\nmalcogido/a!\nconchuda!\nputo/a!\nsorete mal cagado!\nImperatives\nFrom a strictly linguistic point of view, it is interesting that many bad-sounding expressions also convey an order.\n¡ANDATE A + FEMININE DEFINITE ARTICLE + [NOT A VERY NICE PLACE TO BE]!\nAndate a\nla\nmierda\n﻿\nputa que te parió\n﻿\n﻿\nconcha de tu madre\n﻿\n﻿\nconcha de tu hermana\nOf course, the ones below couldn’t be left out. I offer a literal translation next to them:\nANDÁ A CAGAR\n[go take a shit]\nCHUPAME UN HUEVO\n[suck me an egg]\nCHUPAME LA CONCHA\n[suck my pussy]\nCERRÁ EL ORTO\n[close your ass]\nNegative Imperatives\nNo me rompas\nlas pelotas\nlos huevos\nNo seas\nboludo/a, pelotudo/a, forro/a, hijo/a de puta, tarado/a, estúpido/a, pajero/a\nKeep your ears perked, you’ll certainly hear some of these sooner or later.\nIf you’re serious about learning the small things that make Argentinian Spanish different, visit the\nArgentinian Spanish Crash Course\n.

And that means that we’re saving energy to apply it in the areas where it feels absolutely essential.\nUnfortunately, it means language learning gets pushed to the back burner until further notice.\nI get it —it’s not always self-sabotage. It’s life and it’s chores and it’s the less flexible parts of your routine.\nAnd to be honest, it does not need to be the end of the year. The end of the year only makes it worse. That’s why it’s better to have strategies in place that save you the pain of regretting not doing what you aimed for.\nBut don’t make it the end of your language learning goal! Don’t quit altogether (don’t be so dramatic).\nEasier said than done, right?\nOne the many strategies we can implement to stay consistent in our language learning is surprisingly simple: doing a little is better than not doing nothing at all.\nBy embracing this mindset you could avoid the common pitfall I see students encounter more frequently than you’d imagine.\nTake 10 minutes off your day in the most realistically possible moment and do something —anything— with your target language:\nReview your notes\nGo through your flashcards (or create new ones with fresh vocabulary)\nListen to a podcast episode\nWatch a YT video\nWrite a paragraph\nCheck the headlines of AR newspapers (if you dare!)\nRead a page of a book\nGet creative! If you’re feeling up to it, do something more actively engaging like reading or writing. If not, do something more receptive. But be there for those 15 minutes. Don’t multitask.\nIt’s the buzzword of our times: building a habit is difficult, sure, but is far from impossible for anyone who has a reason to stay in the game..\nLast week one student who’s been taking lessons with me for over three years shared a phrase that illustrates this:\nMost people overestimate what they can do in a day but they underestimate what they can achieve in a year.\nSo, come on. Shake off your rust and finish the year strong!\nPS: No [insert your name here], I’m not talking to you.

If someone cuts to the chase, skipping unnecessary introductions, then you’d say, that person “va a los bifes”.\nThe phrase is also commonly used when referring to getting down to work, especially when it’s mentally or physically demanding.\nAlso, it’s an euphemism for having sex with someone you’re getting to know. Someone might say:\n“Bueno, llegamos a su casa y enseguida fuimos a los bifes.”\nThe origin of the phrase is debated, but there are two main theories. One suggests it comes from Argentine food culture, where bife (steak) represents the main course—so ‘going to the steak’ would mean getting straight to what’s important. Another theory ties it to boxing slang, where bifes was used to refer to punches, meaning to get straight into the fight without hesitation.\nHope you like the phrase, and that it gives you food for thought.\nNext Post »\nPhrasal Verbs in RPS\nPrevious Post »\nMy curated list of Argentinian authors\nYou might also want to read these articles:\nThe Paradox of Choice\nToday, I want to introduce the concept of paradox of choice, and show you how it’s detrimental to your progress.\nArgentinian Spanish Input (part 1)\nIn this post, I included podcasts you can try to leverage your learning with natural input.\nEl que te jedi\nLearn a fun way of saying you-know-who in Rioplatense Spanish.\nInfumable\nHave you heard Argentinians using this word before?

They expect the teacher will channel all his/her superpowers and pass them on to them.\nMany skills, you can learn  through this transfer of knowledge process, i.e. someone shows you how to do it and once you know the motions, you hopefully get better at it. But don’t be tricked to think that you only need a tutor to get where you want to be, languagewise. A tutor  can be a valuable gear but is certainly not\nthe only\ngear.\nI refer to this as owning your learning. If you own your learning, you take responsibility in your learning and you hold yourself accountable for attaining your goals.\nThe file I’ve attached below is a questionnaire I adapted from the ‘Strategy Inventory for Language Learning’ (SILL). It was proposed by Rebecca Oxford in 1990 for English learners.\nI updated it to this 21st century context, where there are more resources available than back then. I named this version simply Language Learning Strategies.\nAnyways, this questionnaire is meant to provide you with some feedback that you can apply to your learning.\nClick on the link below to download it for free:\nLANGUAGE LEARNING STRATEGIES\nHope it helps you to fine tune your learning,\nUntil next time,\nNext Post »\nMuy gasolero = Thrifty\nPrevious Post »\nRedefining what a lesson is\nYou might also want to read these articles:\nThe Paradox of Choice\nToday, I want to introduce the concept of paradox of choice, and show you how it’s detrimental to your progress.\nArgentinian Spanish Input (part 1)\nIn this post, I included podcasts you can try to leverage your learning with natural input.\nEl que te jedi\nLearn a fun way of saying you-know-who in Rioplatense Spanish.\nInfumable\nHave you heard Argentinians using this word before?

This article stems from there.\nFirst question: Do you do self-talk? Or does the thought of it make you cringe?\nWhile we all have inner conversations, I think it’s a minority that has conversations out loud. I personally don’t engage in self conversation out loud unless I’m using a foreign language.\nMaybe using the words self-talk and conversations is misleading. What I’m referring to is simply using your target language (in this case, Spanish) when you’re alone and not in an actual dialogue with someone else.\nSelf-talk can be a fantastic way to practice and improve your Spanish.\nHow? Well, the answer is… it’s up to you.\nYou can do self-talk when you’re working, when you’re watching a movie, when you’re running errands or deep cleaning your home. You don’t need a specific setting or elaborate plan.\nAnd, full disclosure, the speaking out loud part is not mandatory. You can still do silent self talk.\nWhat you’ll be missing  is the opportunity to listen to how the words in your mind actually sound when you try to pronounce them, and how your sentences flow from start to finish. This is not something to pass by\nIdeas to get started\nIf the idea of self-talk feels overwhelming, here are some simple ways to ease into it:\nDescribe Your Surroundings\n: Look around and name what you see in Spanish.\nNarrate Your Actions\n: Talk through what you’re doing.\nSet Daily Challenges\n: Choose a topic for the day and talk about it. For instance, you could talk about your plans, reflect on your mood or retell an actual conversation you had with someone.\nPractice Phrases You Struggle With\n: If there’s a structure or vocabulary you find challenging, incorporate it into your self-talk.\nPlan Conversations\n: Imagine how a conversation with someone might go. Pretend you’re first getting to know someone or that you’re ordering food at a restaurant, for example.\nHow to Stay Consistent\nTo make self-talk a habit, try these tips:\nSet a Time\n: Dedicate a few minutes each day to practicing self-talk. It could be during your morning routine or while you wind down in the evening.\nMix It Up\n: Combine self-talk with other activities. For example, describe what’s happening in a TV show you’re watching or summarize the plot of a book you’re reading.\nI hope this click for you, as it has for me!\nGood luck and until next time.\nNext Post »\nATR | A Todo Ritmo\nPrevious Post »\nLittle wonders\nYou might also want to read these articles:\nThe Paradox of Choice\nToday, I want to introduce the concept of paradox of choice, and show you how it’s detrimental to your progress.\nArgentinian Spanish Input (part 1)\nIn this post, I included podcasts you can try to leverage your learning with natural input.\nEl que te jedi\nLearn a fun way of saying you-know-who in Rioplatense Spanish.\nInfumable\nHave you heard Argentinians using this word before?

As you read in the title, the elements of the equation are memory, ear, and intuition.\nThese three ingredients are key to the mix, so let’s break each one down.\nMEMORY\nFor many students, learning a language is all about having ‘a good memory’. They feel the only way to make progress is by memorizing rules, words and expressions.\nWell, memory is an important element but certainly not the cornerstone. If you rely on your memory, soon enough you’ll run out of storage space and find yourself disappointed at how little you’ve kept after a few weeks (even days) into your learning.\nOf course, memorization is essential for certain aspects, but it has to share the room with ear and also make room for intuition.\nEAR\nFortunately, hearing is included in humans by design. You’ve probably heard the saying that since we have one mouth and two ears, we should listen at least twice as much as we speak. And this goes for life in general, not just language learning!\nWe tend to think that speaking is all that matters, when in reality, we rarely engage in monologues. More often than not, you’ll be interacting with someone else—probably someone who prefers talking over listening, but that’s another story—so it’s something to keep in mind.\nAttentive listening will enable you to become familiar with ‘what sounds right’. The best part is you don’t even need to know why; sometimes you’ll be confident about saying the right thing without theoretical arguments!\nAnd this is closely related to intuition.\nINTUITION\nYou reach a certain point -a bit farther into your learning- when you can bet on the right choice of words or word order based on your accumulated passive exposure and ever evolving knowledge of your target language.\nYou won’t always know the right thing to say in every situation, but recognizing what works in a specific moment is something all language learners experience.\nIt’s common to recall hearing someone say something or having read something which is appropriate at a totally different moment, but you feel confident it’ll work.\nThere you go, this is for me a short and sweet recipe for success.\nHope you dig it!\nAappreciate you making it to the end,\nNext Post »\nInfumable\nPrevious Post »\nPhrasal Verbs in RPS\nYou might also want to read these articles:\nThe Paradox of Choice\nToday, I want to introduce the concept of paradox of choice, and show you how it’s detrimental to your progress.\nArgentinian Spanish Input (part 1)\nIn this post, I included podcasts you can try to leverage your learning with natural input.\nEl que te jedi\nLearn a fun way of saying you-know-who in Rioplatense Spanish.\nInfumable\nHave you heard Argentinians using this word before?

La pasé bárbaro.\n-¿Te gustó la última\npeli\nde Chris Nolan?\n-Sí, tiene algunas partes muy copadas.\n#2 SER COPADO\nIf we use it to describe someone, it means they have a good vibe.\nMeli es muy copada, siempre tiene buen humor.\nMi jefe es muy copado. No tiene historia con nada.\n#3 ESTAR COPADO [con algo]\nWhen we combine COPADO with the verb ESTAR, we mean that we are in a moment of great engagement with something.\nEstoy muy copado con un canal de cocina de YouTube que tiene muchas recetas fáciles.\n#4 COPARSE [con algo]\nAs a pronominal verb, it’s also very frequent. One possibility is when you got hooked with something.\nMe copé con las pelis de Guy Ritchie. Estoy mirándome todas.\nThe other possible use is when you want to check with someone if they’d like to join you in a plan:\n¿Te copás con unas birras hoy?\n#5 ME COPA like ME GUSTA\nBasically, Me copa means Me gusta in a more fancy way.\n-¿Te gusta el reggae?\n-Sí, me\nre\ncopa\nHope you liked this one,\nUntil next time,\nHappy Spanish learning!\nNext Post »\nExpressions with CAGAR and CAGARSE\nPrevious Post »\nCold practice, your secret trick\nYou might also want to read these articles:\nThe Paradox of Choice\nToday, I want to introduce the concept of paradox of choice, and show you how it’s detrimental to your progress.\nArgentinian Spanish Input (part 1)\nIn this post, I included podcasts you can try to leverage your learning with natural input.\nEl que te jedi\nLearn a fun way of saying you-know-who in Rioplatense Spanish.\nInfumable\nHave you heard Argentinians using this word before?

Of course everyone is different and has personal preferences which in turn influence their choices, and it’s not rare to find students who adapt to the role of the-one-who-learns-from-someone-who-teaches-them.\nSome time ago I wrote an article (\nThe role of grammar, your tutor and input\n) where I tried to establish a common ground, making the point that a tutor is not all you need to succeed in learning.\nNow, more than ever before, we have access to thousands of resources, both online and offline, that should be part of our learning journey.\nSo, what’s a lesson at this point of the 21st Century?\nBasically, a lesson is a period of time where we meet to actively engage with your target language and improve your skills through feedback and modelling. There are explanations, there’s guidance, of course, but there’s a shift in the focus.\nA lesson today is about collaboration. It’s a dynamic space where both tutor and student play active roles. The focus is no longer on passive reception of knowledge but on interaction, practice, and discovery.\nIn this setting, there are explanations and guidance, but they serve as tools to allow learners to engage more deeply with their target language.\nUltimately, what makes a lesson effective isn’t just the transfer of knowledge, but the opportunity it provides to practice, reflect, and refine through meaningful feedback.\nFluency isn’t built on theory alone; it’s built on action. And lessons, at their best, are moments of action—where learning becomes real, relevant, and personal.\nIf you resonate with this, I hope to meet you soon.\nNext Post »\nKnow thyself\nPrevious Post »\nATR | A Todo Ritmo\nYou might also want to read these articles:\nThe Paradox of Choice\nToday, I want to introduce the concept of paradox of choice, and show you how it’s detrimental to your progress.\nArgentinian Spanish Input (part 1)\nIn this post, I included podcasts you can try to leverage your learning with natural input.\nEl que te jedi\nLearn a fun way of saying you-know-who in Rioplatense Spanish.\nInfumable\nHave you heard Argentinians using this word before?

It’s the missing link.\nYou can surround yourself with all sources of information, all types of facts and rules, but you won’t really master a language until you incorporate natural input to your language learning.\nAnd even when you do set off to practice with ‘real life Spanish’, it’s easy to fall into the trap of thinking that you need to stick to resources specifically aimed at language learners.\nYou don’t! Getting exposure to Spanish in a way that aligns with your interests can be\nmuch more enjoyable and organic\n.\nWhether it’s through watching YouTube videos, films or series, listening to podcasts, participating in online communities, reading newsletters, or following people on social media, there are countless opportunities to take advantage of natural input and immerse yourself in the language while also learning about topics which are relevant for you.\nBy choosing resources that match your interests, you’ll be able to learn the language in a more engaging and authentic way, and have more fun along the way.\nI’ve already highlighted the importance of input in\nTHIS ARTICLE\nwhere I also discuss the importance of grammar and the role of a tutor.\nIn this post I want to dive deeper and explore the various ways you can use real life content to boost your Spanish learning.\nBut before we move any further, let’s agree on what natural input is.\nWhat is Natural Language Input?\nNatural language input refers to exposure to language that is used in a natural and authentic way. It involves experiencing language in context, rather than through isolated grammar rules or vocabulary lists, and is characterized by its\nfluidity, unpredictability, and variability\n.\nAuthentic language materials will help you develop and improve your Spanish skills. They will allow you to develop your abilities to understand and produce language in a way that reflects how it is used by native speakers in real-world settings, rather than just in textbooks and/or in formal classroom settings, where everything seems so civil.\nThat sounds so uncomfortable!\nI know it does not sound inviting, but although embracing the challenge of engaging with natural language input may feel daunting at first, by pushing yourself to engage with a variety of authentic resources, you’ll be able to build your skills more quickly and develop the confidence to tackle even the most challenging language tasks.\nWhat sources of Natural Input are there?\nJust think about it. Internet has made it easier than ever to access organic sources of authentic content.\nThere are numerous options and all complement each other. Let’s have a look at the different sources and how you can approach them.\nYouTube Channels\n: Look for channels that cover topics you’re interested in, such as cooking, music, or travel. This way, you’ll be able to immerse yourself in the language while also learning about subjects you’re passionate about.\nPodcasts\n: Choose podcasts that focus on topics you enjoy or that are in line with your personal or professional interests. This way you’ll be more likely to stick with it.\nStreaming platforms\n: Watching TV shows or movies in your target language can be an entertaining way to improve your listening skills and get exposure to native speakers.\nBy the way, earlier this month I published an article dedicated to\nlearning Spanish with movies\n.\nNewspapers\n: Reading a newspaper in your target language can be an excellent way to practice reading and build your vocabulary. Look for the sections you’re most interested in. To make it easier, start with short articles or opinion pieces, and work your way up to longer pieces as your skills improve.\nSubreddits\n: Join subreddits that revolve around your interests, such as art, sports, or technology, rather than just language learning communities. This will provide you with a more authentic and dynamic exposure to the target language.\nNewsletters\n: Subscribe to newsletters that cover topics you’re interested in, such as fashion, politics, or food, or even language learning.\nSocial Media\n: Follow accounts that are related to your interests, such as food bloggers, musicians, or comedians. This will give you a more engaging and authentic exposure to the target language and allow you to participate in real-life conversations and discussions.\nBelieve me: these sources of natural language content are priceless. I deal with content in English as a non-native speaker on a daily basis, and the feeling of accomplishment I get from using it to learn about my topics of interest or stay updated is fabulous. Not only that, but I keep learning new words and phrases all the time.\nAlso, don’t forget that when you engage with natural language input from a variety of sources, you have the chance to hone different language skills\nIn the\nRESOURCES SECTION\nyou can find dozens of cool suggestions for you.\nEssential Toolkit\nDon’t be afraid to challenge yourself with content that seems difficult – with the right tools at your disposal, you might be surprised at how much you can learn!\nThere are a couple of allies you shouldn’t forget to include in your toolbox: a good dictionary extension, as well as human-made subtitles and transcripts whenever they are available.\nIMTRANSLATOR\n– a Chrome extension that enables you to create interlinear texts in more than 20 languages. I’ve already explained how to use IT in\nTHIS ARTICLE\n.\nLANGUAGE REACTOR\n– a fantastic tool to get dual subs (subtitles both in Spanish and in your native language). Read\nTHIS ARTICLE\nto know more about it.\nBy using tools like ImTranslator and Language Reactor, you can expand your language skills by exposing yourself to challenging content that might otherwise be beyond your current level of understanding.\nThese translation and language learning tools can help you overcome language barriers and access a wider range of language learning opportunities, allowing you to push your language learning boundaries and reach new levels of proficiency.\nAlternatively,\nREADLANG\nis another cool Chrome extension you can try. It highlights and translates the words you hover over on a website and then you can create flashcards out of them.\nHowever, don’t just rely on them, as the guiding principle is to get yourself comfortable enough to be able to deal with the content but not so comfortable that you don’t put any effort.\nRECOMMENDED\n:\nSpanish Input’s Guide\nto learning Spanish with YouTube.\nWhy Natural Input is So Helpful?\nSo, what are the benefits of incorporating natural input into your language learning? Well, there are many. Here are the main ones:\nImprove language comprehension\n: Natural language input helps you to understand how words and phrases are used in context and how they are combined to form sentences. This can lead to improved comprehension of the language and the ability to extract meaning from spoken or written language.\nExpand vocabulary\n: Natural language input exposes you to a wide range of vocabulary used in context, which can expand your knowledge of words and phrases and improve your overall ability to use them in the appropriate contexts.\nRefine grammar\n: Natural language input allows you to see grammar rules and patterns used in context, making it easier to understand and apply them.\nEnhance communication skills\n: Exposure to natural language input can help you develop more natural and fluent communication skills.\nBoost motivation\n: Natural language input is usually more engaging and interesting than artificial or textbook language.\nImprove pronunciation\n: Listening to and imitating natural language input can help you improve your pronunciation and intonation.\nGreater confidence\n: Exposure to natural language input can help you feel more comfortable and confident in you language use, particularly in situations where you need to interact with native speakers.\nBetter understanding of regional variations\n: Natural language input can expose you to different regional variations of the language, which can help you understand and appreciate the diversity of the language.\nNatural Input and Comprehensible Input\nIt’s important to note that there is a difference between natural input and comprehensible input. Natural input refers to exposure to the language in its authentic form, as we’ve covered above. However, this doesn’t necessarily mean that every word or phrase needs to be understood for the exposure to be beneficial.\nHow not to use Natural Input?\nAs always, there are ways to get the wrong end of the stick in terms of natural input.\nFirst, while natural input can be an excellent way to improve your language skills, it’s important to remember that simply consuming it passively isn’t enough. To get the most out of your exposure to the target language, it’s essential to actively engage with the material.\nThis means taking the time to focus on the content and actively try to understand what is being said or written. It may also involve taking notes, pausing or rewinding videos, or looking up new vocabulary words that you come across. By actively engaging with the material, you’ll be able to internalize the language in a more meaningful way.\nGo out there and apply what you learn!\nRemember that\nlanguage proficiency is\nnot just about comprehension, but also about communication\n. Even if you understand most of an article, you may still struggle to express yourself effectively in the language. Therefore, you should strive to develop your speaking, writing, and listening skills.\nIt’s important to find opportunities to use the language actively yourself, such as through speaking or writing practice. This can involve finding a language exchange partner, practicing with a tutor, or writing in a journal short summaries of the information you’ve been in contact with.\nIn fact, one of the\nconversation lesson types\nI offer is based on Natural Input and taking the resource chosen by the student as the focus of our lesson. And it works great!\nBy actively using the language yourself, you’ll be able to solidify what you’ve learned and build your confidence as a speaker or writer.\nDon’t miss out on the\nRESOURCES SECTION\n, you’ll probably find something of your interest there!\nHope this article gave you food for thought!\nUntil next time,\nHappy Spanish learning,\nNext Post »\nOral vs Written Resources\nPrevious Post »\nTo chicken out | Arrugar\nYou might also want to read these articles:\nThe Paradox of Choice\nToday, I want to introduce the concept of paradox of choice, and show you how it’s detrimental to your progress.\nArgentinian Spanish Input (part 1)\nIn this post, I included podcasts you can try to leverage your learning with natural input.\nEl que te jedi\nLearn a fun way of saying you-know-who in Rioplatense Spanish.\nInfumable\nHave you heard Argentinians using this word before?

The ultimate paradox, right?\nBut we’re not here today to do philosophy and question life, but to discuss a peculiar (language) learning paradox —the paradox of choice.\nThis is a conversation I’ve had many, many times with different students over time, and it’s one of the reasons why I created the\nFoundations Books series\n.\nWhat is the paradox of choice?\nYou can watch the full video I’m embedding below by polyglot Robin McPherson for a full tour around the idea, but it stems from the assumption that in order to increase our welfare and happines, we need more freedom. And the way to create more freedom is to maximize the amount of choices we have.\nHow we experience it as language learners?\nAs language learners, this translates as endlessly exploring resources and never making actual progress due to the fact you’re constantly expecting the next BIG, ULTIMATE, ULTRA-EFFECTIVE resource that will get your Spanish up to level.\nEspecifically, there are two strong and revealing points to this paradox for language learners:\n#1\nThe more options we’re presented with, the more difficult it becomes to choose. If you’ve ever tried to find the right book to learn Spanish, you know there’re so many options out there. Many of them available for free, some paid, some unreasonably expensive. Is free effective or if I want to really learn I need to pay?\n#2\nKnowing there are other choice we’ve left unexplored sparks the question: “Have I really made a wise choice?”\nI always say that the third conditional (in English, [If I had…, I would have…] and the same structure replicated in Spanish [Si hubiera… , habría…]) is made for neurotic minds that like (or can’t help) playing the game of “What if…?”\nThis leads to nowhere.\nHow can we avoid falling into this black hole?\nHopefully, you can see how this applies to life in general and having a framework to navigate choice is bliss and efficiency “only” a side effect. But let’s stay within the language learning context.\nFrom my own experience, I can tell you the best way to avoid feeling overwhelmed by the amount of unexplored options is taking enough time to consider the resources available and then choosing the one that seems best suited and commiting to it.\nAs simple as that.\nHere’s the video:\nThanks for visiting, and until next time.\nHappy learning,\nPrevious Post »\nArgentinian Spanish Input (part 1)\nYou might also want to read these articles:\nThe Paradox of Choice\nToday, I want to introduce the concept of paradox of choice, and show you how it’s detrimental to your progress.\nArgentinian Spanish Input (part 1)\nIn this post, I included podcasts you can try to leverage your learning with natural input.\nEl que te jedi\nLearn a fun way of saying you-know-who in Rioplatense Spanish.\nInfumable\nHave you heard Argentinians using this word before?

Videopodcast on YouTube where the host touches on grammar topics and alternates with books and cinema reccomendations.\nPocket Spanish\n. One of the few shows I’ve known about for quite a long time. Lots of topics, episodes range from 20-30 minutes in length. Transcripts are made collaboratively by listeners.\nEspañol desde el Sur\n. Cool podcast here. There are transcripts available for each episode.\nEasy Argentine Spanish\n. Another show to learn about local traditions, expressions and celebrations.\nThe Argentine Way\n. Not many episodes, and nothing recent, but the host is from Argentina.\nAprendé Argento\n. Each episode of this show deals with idiomatic expressions.\nSpanish with Sol\n. Only 4 episodes so far, but who knows… maybe more are on the way.\nPODCASTS FOR NATIVES\nAlso, there are many shows that are not aimed at language learnes, but native speakers. The diversity in this category is huge, so I’ll only mention some I enjoyed:\nLos últimos días de Maradona\n. A journalistic podcast that recreates the last year of Maradona before his death in 2020.\nEl Robo del Siglo\n. The real story of a bank robbery that went well until it didn’t. There’s a movie based on it.\nAprende Fácil de Vinos\n. A course to learn everything about wines.\nAnécdotas\n. Video podcast which tells real life stories. Tragic, funny, bizarre, a bit of everything.\nLa Cruda\n. Not my favorite host, but interesting guests.\nEl día en 5\n. A quick daily show to catch up with the current events.\nCharlas filosóficas\n.

One effective tool that language learners often overlook is podcasts. Podcasts can be an excellent way to supplement your Spanish studies and boost your listening comprehension. To me,\nNatural language input\nis the way to go.\nPlus, Venture Out has its own podcast! If you’re interested in picking up the Rioplatense Accent, then “Traé Alfajores” might just be a good fit for you. Click\nHERE\nto learn about it.\nIn this article, we’ll take a closer look at how you can use podcasts to enhance your language learning journey, whether you’re a beginner, intermediate or advanced learner.\nFrom tips on how to approach listening to natural input, to guidance on how to use the transcripts, I’ll provide you with practical recommendations for making the most of your listening practice.\nMindset and Expectations\nThere’s one thing I’d like to address first. When starting out with podcasts, it’s important to set realistic expectations and approach the process with the right mindset. As a beginner, you may struggle to understand everything that’s being said. This can be frustrating and discouraging, but it’s important to remember that this is a normal part of the language learning process.\nBy listening to podcasts regularly, even if you only understand a small portion of what’s being said, you’re exposing yourself to natural language and training your ear to pick up on new words and phrases.\nBe careful, though. Be mindful of the type of podcast you’re going for.\nExtensive and Intensive Approach\nLet me first introduce these two different approaches.\nExtensive listening\nis when you listen to longer pieces of audio, without necessarily focusing on every detail. This approach is helpful for improving your overall comprehension skills and getting used to the natural flow of the language.\nOn the other hand,\nIntensive listening\nis when you focus on understanding every detail of a short piece of audio. It’s an excellent technique for improving your listening skills, as it allows you to analyze the language at a deeper level.\nListen to the podcast more than once\nWhen it comes to listening to podcasts, it’s helpful to take both an intensive and extensive approach.\nOn the first listen, don’t worry too much about understanding every word or phrase. Instead, try to get the gist of what the speaker is saying and think about the overall context of the conversation.\nAfter that, give it another listen to get a more complete understanding and focus on new words or interesting phrases.\nHow to use transcripts\nIf available and accurate, transcripts are fantastic tools.\nContrary to what some language learners believe, using a transcript does not play against your listening practice. By using transcripts, you can enhance your listening skills and improve your overall understanding of spoken language.\nHere are some ways you could take advantage of a transcript:\nBefore listening to an episode, read through the transcript once or twice to get a general idea of what it’s about and allow you to anticipate the vocabulary and grammar used. Then, listen to the episode while following along with the transcript. This can help you to identify new vocabulary, grammar structures, and intonation patterns.\nFor intermediate and advanced learners, try listening to the episode first and then reading the transcript to check your understanding and fill in any gaps.\nPractice shadowing by reading the transcript aloud while listening. Listen to a sentence or paragraph, and repeat it out loud, trying to mimic the speaker’s accent and tone as closely as possible. This can help you improve your pronunciation and speaking skills enormously.\nWhen you feel ready, try to impersonate the host of the show by reading the transcript out loud. Recording it can be benficial, too.\nTranslating the transcript into your native language can help you better understand it and relate to the content of the show.\nAlways keep in mind that transcripts should be used as a supplement, not a crutch. It’s important to continue practicing your listening skills without relying solely on written text.\nFrom INPUT to OUTPUT\nAnother way to make the most out of listening to podcasts is to use them for both language input and output. Listening to a podcast can also be a great opportunity to practice your speaking skills. How? One way to do this is by repeating or summarizing what you heard in the podcast.\nTake notes and then use your own words to summarize the main ideas. Retelling is a powerful practice!\nOkay, all set, you’re ready to learn Spanish with podcasts!\nRemember to be patient and keep at it, even if it feels frustrating at times. With regular practice you’ll be amazed at how quickly your listening skills improve.\nWhy not give “Traé Alfajores” a try? Listen to it on\nSpotify\nor\nApple Podcasts\nHappy listening,\nNext Post »\nAdjectives that change their meaning BEFORE | AFTER\nPrevious Post »\nExpressions with CAGAR and CAGARSE\nYou might also want to read these articles:\nThe Paradox of Choice\nToday, I want to introduce the concept of paradox of choice, and show you how it’s detrimental to your progress.\nArgentinian Spanish Input (part 1)\nIn this post, I included podcasts you can try to leverage your learning with natural input.\nEl que te jedi\nLearn a fun way of saying you-know-who in Rioplatense Spanish.\nInfumable\nHave you heard Argentinians using this word before?
